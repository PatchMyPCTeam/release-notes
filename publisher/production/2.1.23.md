# Publisher Version 2.1.23 - Production

**Release Date:** 2024-05-29

## Overview

This release introduces support for 'Allow available uninstall' in Intune and implements coexistence features to prevent conflicts with Patch My PC Cloud. Multiple improvements enhance detection scripts and custom application handling.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Allow Available Uninstall** - Support for 'Allow available uninstall' in Intune.
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-3213)*
- **Coexistence** - Implement coexistence to ensure customers are aware when a product is already managed by Intune Apps for Patch My PC Cloud.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Regex Detection** - Improve our regex usage in the detection of applications published by Patch My PC.
  - The regex string is now stored in base64 in the PowerShell script to prevent Intune from clobbering UTF8 characters.
- **Installation Logging for Custom Apps** - Enable the '[Manage Installation Logging](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#install-logging)' option at the root of Customer Apps if at least one product supports it.
- **Application Retention for Custom Apps** - Enable the '[Manage application update and retention](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#new-application)' option for Custom apps on the ConfigMgr tab.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Large File Support** - Fixed a bug that caused custom applications with a main file larger than 2GB to fail to process.
- **Dependency Circular Reference** - Fixed a bug that caused a circular reference when processing Intune dependency relationships with greater than 2 layers.
- **Content Retention** - Fixed a bug that caused ConfigMgr applications to be copied for retention even if the current version fails to download.
- **Wildcard Detection** - Ensure proper wildcard support for ? in detection.
- **Translation Fix** - Fixed an incorrect translation for Manage Conflicting Processes. The default English text had the word 'Applications' translated.
