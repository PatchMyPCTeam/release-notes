# Publisher Preview 1.9.9.3 - 2021-01-19

## Overview

This preview release includes improvements and fixes for the Patch My PC Publisher.

## Improvements

- We now support major version supersedence. Previously this was only supported for minor version supersedence. The supersedence options for a product are visible from the view existing custom options dialog

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where if you have supersedence configured to expire based on the "Wait the specified period of time before a superseded software update is expired" option, the update would be expired immediately rather than after the defined period
