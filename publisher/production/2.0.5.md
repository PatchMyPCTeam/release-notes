# Publisher Version 2.0.5 - Production

**Release Date:** 2021-05-24

## Overview

This release adds application retention for ConfigMgr with configurable version counts, introduces custom note fields for products, improves content signing with vendor certificates, and adds scanning for orphaned ConfigMgr deployments.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Application Retention** - Optionally retain X number of previous application revisions when publishing ConfigMgr apps. By default, when the Publisher publishes a new application revision, it will replace the old content with the new content. Note that old content cannot be replaced if there is still a deployment using the content. This feature allows you to specify that a number of old content revisions should not be replaced during a sync.

- **Application Notes** - Add a custom 'Notes' field in the right-click menu for ConfigMgr apps and Intune apps. This allows you to leave yourself a note regarding a change or configuration you made to a product in the Publisher UI. The notes show up in tooltips and can be printed from the app list.

- **Vendor Source Code Signing** - Optionally sign content using the vendor's source code signing certificate for a publisher or catalog publisher. This option is on the right-click menu in the advanced section. This option is only available for products or catalog updates where the vendor certificate is trusted by the Publisher.

- **Scan Orphaned Deployments** - Scans for ConfigMgr applications, packages, and update groups that have a deployment but are disabled or uninstalled in the Publisher. This means that the product is not going to receive future updates/revisions, but that old content still has an active deployment. The tool is available in the ConfigMgr tab under the 'Advanced Tools' menu.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Database Scan Column** - Add a warning to the database scan columns if there is a deployment for a disabled product. The new column is the 'Is Disabled' column, which will display 'Yes - Has Deployment' if a disabled product has a deployment.
- **Naming Convention Logic** - Application naming convention logic should be more resilient and not crash if an invalid/unsupported architecture string (i.e., Anycpu) is present in the additional application settings.
- **Timeout Setting Display** - Display the configured timeout value for conflicting processes in the Publisher in the [Manage Conflicting Process](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) UI.
- **Testing Automation** - Improvements in the Publisher for testing and automation (product publishing based on the [TestAutomationConfiguration.xml file](https://patchmypc.com/test-automation-enhancements-based-on-testautomationconfigurationxml) in the folder that contains the Publisher executable).

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Closing Published Updates** - Fixed a bug where an app may exist in WSUS/ConfigMgr but not in the Publisher's XML and double-clicking the Published Updates console extension shows a blank form with an exception.
- **Database Scan Scope** - Fixed a bug where the ConfigMgr Database scan would show all content ever published even if the ConfigMgr scope filter was configured.
- **Custom Folder Names** - Fixed a bug where custom ConfigMgr Update Package folder names may not work when multiple update packages are configured.
- **Group Change Detection** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would fail to detect Intune assignment group changes if 'Include' and 'Exclude' were flipped.
- **PowerShell Detection Script** - Fixed a bug where the Intune detection method would fail if the PowerShell detection script failed.
- **Group UI Validation** - Fixed a bug where it was possible to create an invalid assignment if the Product rule for Intune included and excluded the same group.
