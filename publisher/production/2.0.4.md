# Publisher Version 2.0.4 - Production

**Release Date:** 2021-04-30

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Application Name Template** - Allow template of ConfigMgr Application Names. This template allows you to place the version number before the application name or to remove the version altogether. The option is on the right-click menu in the advanced section. You can also remove the publisher name and architecture.

- **Published Updates Console Extension** - The '[Published Updates console extension](https://patchmypc.com/check-for-product-updates-via-the-configmgr-console-extension)' will now display all of the products that have been published by the Publisher, not just the products that are currently enabled in the Publisher. This allows customers to see and manage any products ever published even if the product was manually disabled or deleted from the catalog. The old behavior may have led users to believe something is broken when double-clicking a product that is not currently enabled in the Publisher.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **PreventStart Cleanup** - If for some reason the ScriptRunner doesn't properly clean up the PreventStart registry it creates (IFEO Registry) the Publisher will now do it during a sync. This will ensure that if something goes wrong with the ScriptRunner cleanup when updating a conflicting process configuration that the IFEO Registry is properly removed/re-created during the next sync.
- **App State Management** - The Prevent Start feature for Manage Conflicting Process will no longer restore a program state when closing the application. For example, if Excel is minimized before being closed, ScriptRunner previously would have restarted Excel and kept it minimized. Now, ScriptRunner will always restore the application.
- **ConfigMgr Detection Method** - Improved ConfigMgr detection method for apps. The enhanced detection will now also check the registries 32-bit hive.

- **Graph API Exception** - Fixed a bug where an exception could occur when processing Graph API responses.
