# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.12.33

**Release Date:** 2023-03-08

## Overview

This preview release adds support for creating Available assignments for All Devices in Intune, enables CAB file imports when importing tenants, and fixes several bugs related to datetime formatting and ConfigMgr detection.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **All Devices Available Assignment** - Add support for creating an Available assignment for All Devices. This was previously not supported by Intune. Support has been added, and the Patch My PC UI now allows it as well.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **CAB Import Support** - Added the option to import CAB files when importing tenants.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Application Manager Deletion** - Fixed a bug where an exception may occur if deleting a large number of Intune Applications using the Intune Application Manager Utility
- **Data Export Dates** - Fixed a bug where some data exports would result in malformed date time strings. This occurred if a culture used the same character for the number group separator and for time parts.
- **ConfigMgr Detection Logging** - Fixed a bug where ConfigMgr detection script logging did not use an invariant date-time format. This could cause CMTrace to fail to parse the logs.
- **MCP Logging Format** - Fixed a bug where Manage Conflicting Process logging did not use an invariant date-time format. This could cause CMTrace to fail to parse the logs.
- **Prescript Abort Exception** - Fixed a bug where the option to abort an uninstall if the prescript failed caused an argument parsing exception.
- **Settings Backup** - Fixed a bug where the automatic backup of setting changes would fail in certain cultures due to a date-time parsing issue.
- **Naming Convention Copy** - Fixed a bug where custom naming conventions were copied between tabs. We no longer copy naming conventions when copying products between tabs.
