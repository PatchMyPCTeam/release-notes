# Publisher Version 2.1.16 - Production

**Release Date:** 2023-07-06

## Overview

This release updates the Intune Application Manager Utility to use aggregate reports, preventing 429 errors, and addresses Graph API schema changes affecting Power BI reports.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Application Manager Aggregate Reports** - Update the Intune [Application Manager Utility](https://patchmypc.com/intune-application-manager-utility) to use the [aggregate reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/reports-export-graph-available-reports) for both the collection of applications, as well as application extended info. This prevents a 429 when retrieving the data.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Graph API Schema Changes** - Updated Publisher to reflect changes in Graph API schema. This should resolve issues with the [Patch My PC Intune reports](https://patchmypc.com/power-bi-reports-for-microsoft-intune-third-party-updates).
