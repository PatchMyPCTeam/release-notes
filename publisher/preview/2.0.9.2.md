# Publisher Preview Version 2.0.9.2

**Release Date:** 2021-09-09

## Overview

This preview release adds autocomplete for file paths and URLs in text boxes, improves MCP notification language for updates, and fixes several bugs related to folder validation and assignment copying.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Autocomplete Paths** - Text boxes within the UI now implement an autocomplete for file paths and URLs.
- **Update Language** - The [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) notification will now display 'update' based language for an Intune Update. For example, the button will say 'Close and Update' instead of 'Close and Install.'

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Source Folder Validation** - Fixed a bug where the ConfigMgr [source folder validation](https://patchmypc.com/smsprovider-connection-and-source-folder-options#Source-Folder-Validation) would perform a partial match, such as \\\server\source\_apps being considered a conflict for \\\server\source. We now append a trailing slash to the comparison.
- **Prevent Start Error** - Fixed a bug where the 'Prevent Start…' option for [Manage Conflicting Process](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) would throw an access denied error instead of the desired message box.
- **Assignment Tab Copy** - Fixed a bug where assignments would be copied from Intune app to Intune updates when the copy between tabs is used.
- **Custom Return Codes** - Fixed a bug where custom return codes set in the catalog were not processed for updates by the Publisher.
- **MCP Revision** - Fixed a bug where ConfigMgr applications would be revised every sync when the Manage Conflicting Process option is set to an option other than 'Notify'
