## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Binary Download Staging** - Use a temporary staging directory for binary downloads when processing ConfigMgr applications.
- **Cloud Connection Handling** - Improved handling of the cloud connection.
- **Content Resolution** - Improved how ConfigMgr content is resolved to ensure we choose non-retained applications if present.
- **Contextual MCP Icons** - The tooltip and icon for Manage Conflicting Processes suggested configurations are now more contextual.
  - If configured to Kill or Notify, the tooltip and icon are removed
  - If configured to Skip, the icon is shown, and the tooltip says, "Manage Conflicting Processes is recommended for this product and will be configured to Skip by default"
  - If configured to 'Perform the installation,' the icon is shown, and the tooltip says, "Manage Conflicting Processes is recommended for this product but is currently not configured"

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Application Update Prevention** - Fixed a bug that caused the 'Prevent the end-user from opening an application while the application is updating' feature to not work for ConfigMgr or Intune applications in some instances.
- **Requirement Rule Updates** - If a product is renamed, the requirement rules for Intune Updates may not update as expected. This applies to custom applications and Patch My PC catalog applications. The old requirement rule for an Intune Update would be left behind. The requirement rules should now be maintained as expected when a product is renamed.
