- **Native Script Signing** - Use windows native methods for signing PowerShell scripts.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Version Regex Extraction** - PowerShell detection scripts will use regex to extract the version from the displayVersion field to account for vendors that put more than the version in the field.
- **Registry Error Suppression** - Set ErrorAction to SilentlyContinue for extra regkey validation checks to suppress errors in the event the key does not exist.
- **Installer Delay** - Add a delay in Scriptrunner if the main installer exits in less than 2 seconds. This is to account for installers that spawn child processes.
