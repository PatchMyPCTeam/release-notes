# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.29.60

**Release Date:** 2025-01-17

## Overview

This preview release introduces environment variable expansion in ScriptRunner with new placeholders (%PRODUCTNAME%, %VERSION%, %VENDORNAME%), adds support for 32-bit process configuration in ConfigMgr, and improves search functionality to include custom applications.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Environment Variable Expansion** - Scriptrunner will now expand environment variables provided in custom command line arguments and pre-post script arguments. Additionally the below variables are available:
  - %PRODUCTNAME%
  - %VERSION%
  - %VENDORNAME%
- **32-bit Process Support** - Add support for Patch My PC to configure the 'Run installation and uninstall program as 32-bit process on 64-bit clients' option within ConfigMgr. This will not be a customer exposed option in the Publisher, but something that Patch My PC can set to ensure applications install as expected.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Custom App Search** - The search functionality in the product treeviews now consider custom applications. Previously the list of custom products would not be included in the search.
- **End-of-Life Logging** - Improved logging during a Publisher synchronization for products that are marked [end-of-life](https://patchmypc.com/how-products-are-handled-at-end-of-life-eol-or-become-incompatible) by Patch My PC.
- **Intune Terminology** - Update some labels and logging to be in line with the latest terminology used in Intune.
- **ScriptRunner Logging** - The Update ID and Update Title are now written to the PatchMyPC-Scriptrunner log file.
- **Save Event Tracking** - The username of the user who performed a save in the Publisher is now written to the event log, and to the PatchMyPC log file. Additionally an empty file with a GUID name is included in the CAB so the save event can be matched to CAB file.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Service Startup** - Fixed a bug that caused the service not to start if no settings.xml file existed.
  - This only impacted preview builds and did not ship to production.
- **Settings Backup CAB** - Fixed a bug where the metadata of the settings backup CAB file was using absolute paths, making the CAB appear empty when viewed through Windows explorer.
  - This only impacted preview builds and did not ship to production.
- **Cloud Product Selections** - Fixed a bug where cloud Product Selections were only displayed in the Publisher if the product was both deployed in the cloud, and selected in the Publisher. Products which are not selected in the Publisher will now properly show as managed by the cloud if a deployment exists.
- **CVE Import Tool** - Fixed a bug causing the CVE Import tool not to load.
  - This only impacted preview builds and did not ship to production.
