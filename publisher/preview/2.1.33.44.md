# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.33.44

**Release Date:** 2025-04-09

## Overview

This preview release extends Intune MCP runtime limits, adds Japanese localization, enhances ScriptRunner logging, and resolves multiple bugs including right-click option performance, product selection loading, and custom application handling.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Extended Intune Runtime** - Allow a maximum run time of 1440 minutes for Manage Conflicting Processes for Intune.
- **Enhanced ScriptRunner Logging** - Add the user name, user domain, device name, session ID and Windows OS version to the PatchMyPC-Scriptrunner.log.
- **Certificate Validation Logging** - Collect additional information regarding certificate validation failures.
- **Japanese Localization** - Add Japanese localization text for Manage Conflicting Processes.
- **Retention Copy Safety** - Stop processing a ConfigMgr application if the copy operation for retention fails. This ensures we do not edit an existing app unless the copy succeeds.
- **Sync Time Logging** - Added the total sync time to the PatchMyPC.log
- **Cloud Deployment Logging** - Improved logging when there is a cloud connection, but no Intune deployments in the cloud.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Right-Click Performance** - Fixed a bug that caused some right-click options, such as setting an update to metadata only, to take a long time to apply when set at the 'All Products' level.
- **Product Selection Loading** - Fixed a bug that caused the Publisher to fail to load the complete list of selected products from settings.
- **CVE Import Wizard** - Fixed a bug causing the Publisher to fail to process selections from the CVE Import Wizard.
- **Search Box Retention** - Fixed a bug that caused the treeview searchbox not to retain the previous search text.
- **Placeholder Expansion** - Fixed a bug causing scriptrunner not to expand placeholder arguments such as %CURRENTDIR% when parsing command line arguments.
- **Mutex Timeout** - Fixed a bug causing errors similar to 'Mutex access requested by GetIntuneAppProductFlags but a timeout occurred while waiting for mutex to be released'
- **Duplicate File Names** - Fixed a bug that caused custom applications to fail if they had two files with the same name inside their content.
