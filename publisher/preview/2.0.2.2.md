## Improvements

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Intune Proxy** - Connections to Intune may not respect the proxy configuration set in the Publisher.
- **Package Details** - 'Show Package Details…' right-click option would not load as expected.
- **CVE Wizard Loading** - CVE Wizard would not load as expected.
- **SSRS Compliance** - SSRS dashboards would report a negative % for compliance in some scenarios. The reports can be reinstalled if you are affected by following the same process as the initial install which will overwrite the reports.
