#### New Features

**Portal**

* **New "Usage" page –** We now show the usage limits for your PMPC Cloud company and your current usage to allow you to see when what you are using and when you are approaching a limit.
* **New tooltip for MSP deployments –** Now if you select the **.msp** installer when creating a deployment, we pop-up a warning that you will only be able add an Update Only assignment to this deployment and you should select the **.exe** installer if you want to use the other assignment types.
* **New default variant logic –** We’ve now replaced our existing language-only priority when creating a deployment with logic based on language, installation context, architecture, and installer type.

#### Fixes

**Portal**

* Resolved an issue with Entra ID Groups not being sorted alphabetically in the portal when searching to add them to an assignment.
