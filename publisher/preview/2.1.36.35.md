# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.36.35

**Release Date:** 2025-06-12

## Overview

This preview release adds a configurable timeout for Intune reports, improves certificate validation handling, and resolves issues with ConfigMgr content selection and notification display.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Intune Reports Timeout** - Add an [IntuneReportsRequestTimeout registry option](https://patchmypc.com/kb/registry-publisher-config#h-change-the-timeout-for-intune-reports) to set the timeout for Intune reports. The default value is five minutes.
- **Tooltip Updates** - Update tooltips in the Publisher UI for Manage Conflicting Process timeouts to reflect Intune changes.
- **Certificate Validation** - If the code signing certificate is not found, then WSUS updates will not process.
- **Detection Script Signing** - If the code signing certificate is not found and ConfigMgr detection script code signing is enabled, then ConfigMgr apps will not process.
- **Notification Settings Handling** - Improve the handling of UINotificationSettings.xml for Manage Conflicting Processes. They are now generated per session.
  - XML per session prevents access denied errors that can occur when one user creates a file and another non-admin user later attempts to edit it.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **SMS Content Selection** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher may select the incorrect SMS\_Content instance in some cases when searching for a previous ConfigMgr application.
  - This fix addresses the alert "Unable to process \<Application Name>. PackageId… does not find an application with a matching content source path…"
  - Refer to this [KB article](https://patchmypc.com/kb/packageid-found-does-not-find-an-application-with-matching-content-source-path/) for more information.
- **Focus Assist Error** - Fixed a bug that caused customers to see an error message if ScriptRunner tries to display a notification while Focus Assist is enabled.
- **Postponed Binaries** - Fixed a bug that caused Postponed binaries to fail to process when custom applications are enabled and the PostponedBinaries folder does not exist.
