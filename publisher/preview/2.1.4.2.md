## Overview

This preview release adds German and Dutch translations for Manage Conflicting Processes, enables Intune Filter management across all assignment instances, and introduces CAB format for settings backups.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **German and Dutch MCP** - Adding German and Dutch translations to [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#manage-conflicting-processes)
- **Intune Filter Management** - Intune Filter viewing and configuration is now available in all instances of managing Intune Win32 assignments in the Publisher.
- **CAB Settings Format** - All setting backups are now in a .CAB format. The import setting option now allows for .XML or .CAB import to ensure we support importing older setting files.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Scriptrunner Uninstall String** - Fixed a bug where scriptrunner may fail to find the uninstall string in the registry for some products.
- **Installation Validation** - Fixed a bug where scriptrunner may fail to validate an installation after the installer completes causing a 3-minute delay after the installation completes.
- **Pause with Postponed Binaries** - Fixed a bug where [Pause](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#pause-product-updates) does not account for postponed binaries. If there is an existing postponed binary it will publish even if a pause is set.
- **Publishing Count** - Fixed a bug where some publishing summarization info was miscounted in the PatchMyPC.log file.
- **Empty Folder Cleanup** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would leave behind an empty folder when Publishing a ConfigMgr application and the download fails.
- **Retention Versioning** - Fixed a bug where a version number would be appended to the current ConfigMgr application instead of the retaining application if the download fails. This bug affected customers who had the 'Do not include version…' option configured as well as the 'Retain…' option.
