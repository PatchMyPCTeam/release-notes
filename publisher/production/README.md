# Publisher Release Notes

_Applies to: Patch My PC On-Premises Publisher_

Details the production release history for Patch My PC's (PMPC's) On-premises Publisher, the most recent release being shown first.

## 2.1.36.0 - 2025-05-05

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* When processing a ConfigMgr app, the Publisher will validate that the PackageId found in a package.xml maps to an application deployment type with a matching content source path.&#x20;
* If a ConfigMgr application copy fails, the left-behind content is also removed.&#x20;

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a bug that caused the MCP User Notification Timeout to not be translated from minutes to seconds when written to package.xml. The result is a notification being open for 5 seconds instead of 300 seconds, for example.
  * Note: To fix existing apps or updates with this issue [Republish the App or Update](https://patchmypc.com/when-and-how-to-republish-third-party-updates).
* Fixed a bug that resulted in an error when attempting to save a MCP User Notification Timeout Setting.
* Fixed a bug that caused postponed custom ConfigMgr applications to not publish as expected.
* Fixed a bug where the option to select the ConfigMgr folder within the [ConfigMgr application creation options ](https://patchmypc.com/application-creation-options)was not available.

## 2.1.35 - 2025-04-23

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* Allow a maximum run time of 1440 minutes for Manage Conflicting Processes for Intune.
* Add the user name, user domain, device name, session ID and Windows OS version to the PatchMyPC-Sriptrunner.log.
* Collect additional information regarding certificate validation failures.
* Add Japanese localization text for Manage Conflicting Processes.
* Stop processing a ConfigMgr application if the copy operation for retention fails. This ensure we do not edit an existing app unless the copy succeeds.
* Added the total sync time to the PatchMyPC.log
* Improved logging when there is a cloud connection, but no Intune deployments in the cloud.

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a bug that caused some right-click options, such as setting an update to metadata only, to take a long time to apply when set at the ‘All Products’ level.
* Fixed a bug that caused the Publisher to fail to load the complete list of selected products from settings.
* Fixed a bug causing the Publisher to fail to process selections from the CVE Import Wizard.
* Fixed a bug that caused the treeview searchbox not to retain the previous search text.
* Fixed a bug causing scriptrunner not to expand placeholder arguments such as %CURRENTDIR% when parsing command line arguments.
* Fixed a bug causing errors similar to ‘Mutex access requested by GetIntuneAppProductFlags but a timeout occurred while waiting for mutex to be released’
* Fixed a bug that caused custom applications to fail if they had two files with the same name inside their content.
* Fixed a bug that caused email reports to erroneously indicate a pause product for tenants that do not have the product enabled.

## 2.1.33 - 2025-02-13

### Features <a href="#features" id="features"></a>

* Support applications in the catalog that download a zip file.
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-1463](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1463)
  * Note: Additional backend and procedural changes are needed before this will be used. The Publisher can consume a catalog with software that downloads a zip file. We will not add any products like this until Q1-Q2 2025.&#x20;
  * Scriptrunner will now expand environment variables provided in custom command line arguments.
  * Add support for Patch My PC to configure the ‘Run installation and uninstall program as 32-bit process on 64-bit clients’ option within ConfigMgr. This will not be a customer exposed option in the Publisher, but something that Patch My PC can set to ensure applications install as expected.&#x20;

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* Improve how the Publisher reads and writes settings.
  * Prevent the Publisher from overwriting user setting changes while a sync is happening. Previously, if a user was in the UI and clicked save while a sync was running, the user’s changes could be lost.
  * Prevent the Publisher from losing Intune configuration due to an abandoned mutex.
* If found, the ‘Collect Logs’ button will now include the WSUS softwaredistribution.log.
* Improve the product search function in the Publisher to keep the search box open when no match is found.
* Scriptrunner has improved logic for handling the log location for user-based installations. If the default values are left in the Publisher, the log path will be updated to a user-writable location. This includes the scriptrunner log and the installer log.
* Updated Publisher settings backup retention to retain settings from previous weeks and months.
* Update the Swedish translation for Manage Conflicting Processes based on customer feedback.
* The search functionality in the product treeviews now consider custom applications. Previously the list of custom products would not be included in the search.
* Improved logging during a Publisher synchronization for products that are marked [end-of-life](https://patchmypc.com/how-products-are-handled-at-end-of-life-eol-or-become-incompatible) by Patch My PC.
* Update some labels and logging to be in line with the latest terminology used in Intune.
* The Update ID and Update Title are now written to the PatchMyPC-Scriptrunner log file.
* The username of the user who performed a save in the Publisher is now written to the event log, and to the PatchMyPC log file. Additionally an empty file with a GUID name is included in the CAB so the save event can be matched to CAB file.

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a bug where Graph queries would fail if they contained a date-time filter and the machine running the Publisher had the OS set to specific cultures.
* Fixed a bug where a ‘BaseInstallOnlyNotForUpdating\_’ prefix would appear when using the %OriginalName% variable.
* Fixed a bug where an invalid logging path was allowed, causing the Publisher not to log anything to disk.
* Fixed a bug where canceling out of the Dynamic Assignments form would still apply the settings.
* The test email for SMTP configuration had a blank subject and body.
* Fixed a bug causing the Manage Assignments form to hang while resolving Entra group names in some scenarios.
* Fixed a bug where the Publisher would include non-Windows applications in the scan results for Intune auto publishing.
* Fixed a bug that caused webhook summary notifications not to respect the tenant filter.&#x20;
* Fixed a bug that caused the Publisher to attempt to code sign Patch My PC defined scripts when the code signing option was disabled in the Publisher.
* Fixed a bug that caused the install time offset for Intune assignments to be displayed incorrectly in some cultures.&#x20;
* Fixed a bug where cloud Product Selections were only displayed in the Publisher if the product was both deployed in the cloud, and selected in the Publisher. Products which are not selected in the Publisher will now properly show as managed by the cloud if a deployment exists.&#x20;

## 2.1.29 - 2024-11-03

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* Intune Updates will now have the icon for the product associated with them.
* Added Czech, Finnish, and Norwegian translations for [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications).
* Fixed Danish translation for [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications).
* Imported banner images are stored in the installation directory of the Publisher instead of referencing the source file.
* Removed the references for the SSRS reports and replaced them with [Advanced Insights](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-insights/overview).
* The Win32AppId is now included in the PatchMyPC-PublishingHistory.csv file.
* Improved the handling of signed scripts when publishing. Sometimes, the Publisher would fail to replace a file and throw an exception. We now ensure the destination file is deleted before moving in the updated file.

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a bug that caused the synchronization to stop if a tenant failed authentication. This impacted the Publisher with an MSP license and a multi-tenant setup.
* Fixed a discrepancy between the PowerShell detection scripts and the ScriptRunner detection logic.
* Fixed a bug with the filtering options for webhook notifications. The notifications should now be correctly filtered when the summary option and scope are set. For example, ‘Send alerts as each product is published…’ is unchecked, and only ‘Include Intune update notifications’ is checked.&#x20;

## 2.1.28 - 2024-09-26

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* Updated [telemetry](https://patchmypc.com/telemetry-data-collected-when-using-the-publisher) to include the list of selected products.

## 2.1.27 - 2024-09-10

### Features <a href="#features" id="features"></a>

* Added support for Microsoft Teams Workflows as a new webhook provider option. With the announced [retirement of Office 365 connectors within Microsoft Teams](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-office-365-connectors-within-microsoft-teams/), we now support the new Workflow options. Our Teams notifications have been updated with new ⁠[Adaptive Card](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/adaptive-cards/) templates.

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* Configured [return codes](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#manage-return-codes) are updated on sync for ConfigMgr applications, Intune applications, and Intune updates. If there is a mismatch between the settings in the Publisher and the published application, then the return codes from the settings will be applied. It is no longer necessary to republish a product to update the return codes.
* Add support for passing additional headers when downloading binaries. This is metadata maintained by Patch My PC.

### Fixes

* Fix a bug that caused republishing a custom ConfigMgr application with additional files to fail in some scenarios.
* Fixed a bug where the return codes in settings could be duplicated if the treeview was refreshed, or you switch tenants in a multi-tenant setup.&#x20;
* Update Intune detection to account for registry detection checking for a nonexistent property. We now allow a NotEquals check for a property that might not exist. Previously, this would cause an unhandled exception.

## 2.1.26 - 2024-07-25

### Other

* Signed the installer with our renewed code-signing certificate.

## 2.1.25 - 2024-06-26

### Features <a href="#features" id="features"></a>

* Manage return codes
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-556](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-556)

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* Use a temporary staging directory for binary downloads when processing ConfigMgr applications
* Improved handling of the cloud connection.
* Improved how ConfigMgr content is resolved to ensure we choose non-retained applications if present.
* The tooltip and icon for Manage Conflicting Processes suggested configurations are now more contextual.
  * If configured to Kill or Notify, the tooltip and icon are removed
  * If configured to Skip, the icon is shown, and the tooltip says, “Manage Conflicting Processes is recommended for this product and will be configured to Skip by default”
  * If configured to ‘Perform the installation,’ the icon is shown, and the tooltip says, “Manage Conflicting Processes is recommended for this product but is currently not configured”

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a bug that caused the ‘Prevent the end-user from opening an application while the application is updating’ feature to not work for ConfigMgr or Intune applications in some instances.
* If a product is renamed, the requirement rules for Intune Updates may not update as expected. This applies to custom applications and Patch My PC catalog applications. The old requirement rule for an Intune Update would be left behind. The requirement rules should now be maintained as expected when a product is renamed.

## 2.1.24 - 2024-05-30

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* If the temporary file location configured in the Publisher does not exist, we now fall back to the system temporary directory. Previously, if this directory did not exist the PatchMyPcService would fail to start.
* Fixed a bug where the secrets, such as the Intune application registration secret, would not be saved in the correct format on the first UI open for a new install.

## 2.1.23 - 2024-05-29

### Features <a href="#features" id="features"></a>

* Support for ‘Allow available uninstall’ in Intune
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-3213](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-3213)
* Implement coexistence
  * Coexistence ensures the customer is aware when a product is already managed by Intune Apps for Patch My PC Cloud.

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* Improve our regex usage in the detection of applications published by Patch My PC.
  * The regex string is now stored in base64 in the PowerShell script to prevent Intune from clobbering UTF8 characters.
* Enable the ‘[Manage Installation Logging](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#install-logging)‘ option at the root of Customer Apps if at least one product supports it.
* Enable the ‘[Manage application update and retention](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#new-application)‘ option for Custom apps on the ConfigMgr tab.&#x20;

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a bug that caused custom applications with a main file larger than 2GB to fail to process.
* Fixed a bug that caused a circular reference when processing Intune dependency relationships with greater than 2 layers.
* Fixed a bug that caused ConfigMgr applications to be copied for retention even if the current version fails to download.
* Ensure proper wildcard support for ? in detection.
* Fixed an incorrect translation for Manage Conflicting Processes. The default English text had the word ‘Applications’ translated.

## 2.1.22 - 2024-04-16

### Features <a href="#features" id="features"></a>

* It is now possible to adjust the chunk size used for uploading chunks to Azure. It can be [adjusted between 2MB and 12MB](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-configurations-available-using-the-registry-for-patch-my-pcs-publishing-service#AzureUploaderChunkSize).

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* PowerShell detection scripts no longer call whoami. This resolves issues where the PATH environment variable may have conflicting whoami processes.
  * The ‘[recreate detection](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#RecreateDetection)‘ right-click option can be used to generate new scripts with this change. Otherwise, products will have the script updated when a new version is released.
* Product selections are stored and matched based on a product Id
* A message box will appear when a ‘[latest](https://patchmypc.com/products-multiple-versions-patch-my-pc#topic2)‘ product is selected. This message box contains a brief note about how products with multiple versions are handled and provides a help button for [more info](https://patchmypc.com/products-multiple-versions-patch-my-pc#topic2).
* Improve how we search for ConfigMgr application content.
* When creating the cloud connection in the Publisher, the System Default browser will now be used.
  * If needed, the embedded web browser can still be used with a [registry flag](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-configurations-available-using-the-registry-for-patch-my-pcs-publishing-service#MsalUseEmbeddedWebView).
* The ‘[Collect Logs](https://patchmypc.com/logging-options#collectlogs)‘ button now collects all PowerShell detection scripts modified within the last 7 days. The scripts are renamed to have a .txt extension before being added to the zip file.
* Additional default translations added to Manage Conflicting Processes
  * Added German, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish
  * Fixed Dutch translation
* Icons in the product treeview now indicate if the product requires local content, or is configured to skip the install if running by default.

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a bug that caused a null reference exception if a recommended pre script, and a recommended post script were configured on a product.
* The configured proxy will be used to get an access token during cloud connection creation.
* Disconnecting from the cloud tab did not save to settings.

## 2.1.21 - 2024-03-07

  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-1303](https://patchmypc.aha.io/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1303)
  * [Documentation](https://patchmypc.com/ui-doc-publisher-cloud)

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* Improve how the list of custom products is queried from the cloud.
* Improve the cloud connection flow to account for the EU region.
* Various typo corrections in the UI and in the log.&#x20;
* Improve logging for retained ConfigMgr applications.
* Expand out aggregate exceptions when they are logged.&#x20;
* Improved user experience both for a disconnected cloud configuration and an empty custom app list.&#x20;
* Use less memory when uploading .intunewin files to Intune.
* Improve the user experience when the ConfigApi is not available
  * The UI can now start without the ConfigApi being available. A popup message will still appear indicating it cannot be reached.
  * When this is not available, the cloud features of the Publisher will be disabled.

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a bug that made connecting to an EU Patch My PC cloud customer inconsistent.
* Fixed a bug causing the copy between tab options not to work as expected when custom applications are configured.
* Fixed a bug where ESP associations would copy between the Intune Apps and Intune Updates tab.
* Improved how .intunewin files are handled to ensure we can process large files.
* Fixed a bug that caused some right-click options to not clear their state as expected for custom apps.
* Editing Manage Conflicting Process options did not light up the Apply button.
* Fixed a bug that caused the Publisher to fail to retry when uploading chunks to Azure.
* Fixed a bug where a custom application download may compare hash against an older version of the custom application’s hash.&#x20;
* Fixed a bug that caused the treeview to have a yellow background, as if no products are selected, even when products were selected.

## 2.1.19 - 2024-01-16

### Features <a href="#features" id="features"></a>

* Ability to create Custom App updates and base installs (Public preview)
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-1303](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1303)
  * The Publisher must have ‘[Install preview builds](https://patchmypc.com/preview-channel)‘ checked in the About tab.
  * [Setup docs](https://patchmypc.com/ui-doc-publisher-cloud)
  * Custom Applications are supported in the ConfigMgr apps, Intune apps, and Intune updates tabs.
  * A license with one of the below subscription levels is required.
    * Enterprise Plus
    * Enterprise Premium
    * MSP
* Implement Publish Now for Custom Apps
* Support detecting software that translates DisplayName
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-1335](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1335)
* Add support for configuring Win32 application max runtime in minutes
  * ![](/_images/max-runtime.png)

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* \*\*\* Report lines have been updated.
  * As the catalog grows and the number of syncing products increases, our \*\*\* report line has gotten too long! CMTrace does not parse the line, and it will not show it. To prevent this, we have split up the report line into one line per type. Below is an example.
  * ![Patch My PC log file with four separate report lines all prepended by \*\*\*](/_images/report-line-change.png "Patch My PC log file with four separate report lines all prepended by \*\*\*")
* Implement certificate pinning. All requests to Patch My PC domains will have the certificate validated.
* Implement a safety check prior to deleting a ConfigMgr application. In some instances, the SMS provider returns an empty list of apps instead of a connection exception. To account for this, we ensure at least one Site is returned by the SMS provider prior to application deletion.
* ConfigMgr script size is reduced. No functional changes. This should help with metadata download issues over CMG.
* Add support for the ? wildcard character in detection.
* Improve some popup notifications to direct the user to the correct tab.
* Improve cleanup during service shutdown.
* Update the default login authority for Intune. It is now [https://login.microsoftonline.com](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)
  * This will not affect existing Intune configurations. It is only a change to the defaults for a new connection.
* Implement an attempted reconnect when a WMI query fails against the SMS provider.
* Improved scriptrunner logic for finding uninstall strings. DisplayVersion will now have any “-” or “\_” replaced by a “.” when searching for uninstall strings. This matches the behavior of our script based detection.

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a dead ‘More Info’ link for WSUS certificate management.
* Fixed a bug causing dependencies to be removed from an Intune Win32 application when republishing.
* Fixed a bug where publish now and delayed ConfigMgr apps did not work as expected.
* Fixed a bug that caused a new install of Patch My PC Publisher to be in ‘Intune Only Mode’ regardless of the checkbox state.
* Servers are no longer included in Intune device counts.
* Resolved a race condition which caused the additional webhook filtering options to be unavailable in some instances.
* Improved download engine logging to include the URL when the download fails. This was a regression that is now resolved.
* The logging path for Intune [Manage Installation Logging](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#install-logging) incorrectly defaulted to the ConfigMgr path. It is now corrected to the Intune default path for logging.
* For some sync schedules, the ‘Next Sync’ time displayed in the General tab was in UTC instead of local time. The correct time should now be displayed.
* Fix logging during the creation of Intune products when local content lookup fails. The Publisher would incorrectly log that the existing application would be deleted.
* Fixed a bug causing Enforced Uninstall Arguments to be ignored for ConfigMgr apps. This resulted in some ConfigMgr apps being created with an uninstall that may not work as expected. The next sync after the Publisher is updated will fix these products’ uninstall configuration.
* The connection name is now required in the Cloud tab.
* Fixed a bug that caused a Null Reference Exception when exiting the [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) configuration in the Intune apps or Intune updates tab.
  * This was a regression that only impacted preview builds
* Fixed a bug that caused the [custom naming convention](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#IntuneNamingConvention) for ConfigMgr applications to be overwritten during a sync in some cases.
* Fixed a bug where the authorization token can expire when connecting to Custom Apps, requiring a service restart.
* Fixed a bug where Right-Click selections for “All Products” on the “Intune Apps” tab would be lost when custom apps was enabled.
  * This was a regression that only impacted preview builds

## 2.1.18 - 2023-10-16

### Features <a href="#features" id="features"></a>

* Sync only selected apps/updates during a sync
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-468](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-468)
* Allow the management of Delivery Optimization configuration for Intune assignments.
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-2071](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-2071)
  * Note: Existing DO configuration on an assignment will also carry forward now when a new version of the software is Published.
* The [Intune Application Manager Utility](https://patchmypc.com/intune-application-manager-utility) now has some multi-select bulk options.

![A right-click menu in the Intune App manager tool, showing the options available. Manage DO priority. Manage ESP associations. Delete assignments. Delete applications. Extract content(s).](/_images/intune-app-man-bulk-options-zoomed.png "A right-click menu in the Intune App manager tool, showing the options available. Manage DO priority. Manage ESP associations. Delete assignments. Delete applications. Extract content(s).")

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* Implement a new download engine across all components.
* Detection method improvements.
  * Support parsing version numbers that use – or \_ instead of .
* Improved logging regarding installer downloads and sourcing.
* Use CSV-based reporting endpoints for detected software per-computer.
  * This should prevent 429 responses when getting the list of devices with an application.
* WMI connection test to SMS provider prior to deleting ConfigMgr content.
* Improve cleanup of files during the synchronization of Intune.
* Updated the “Enabled” header of CSV exports in scan wizards to be less specific.
* OK button has been changed to ‘Save and Close’
  * Open to feedback on this change. We have received a fair number of reports that it is unclear the ‘OK’ button will close the UI.

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a bug where the wrong ID property was shown in the ‘[Show Package Info](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#PackageInfo)‘  tool for the update ID.
* Fixed a bug where Manage Conflicting Processes may be enabled if [‘Add the executable name in the deployment type’s install behavior’](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#install-behavior) is enabled. This is unexpected behavior that will no longer occur.
* Fixed a bug where multiple threads could access some components of settings at the same time, causing a race condition.
* Fixed a bug where the ‘Change Visibility’ option for WSUS updates would not work if the WSUS DB is called something other than SUSDB.
* Fixed a bug that caused the right-click menu at the root to sometimes not display correctly.
* On the ConfigMgr Apps tab, if the option «Add the executable name in the deployment type’s install behavior» is enabled, the Manage Conflicting Process is automatically enabled to kill processes.
* Fix crash when sorting some columns in the [Manage Assignments tool](https://patchmypc.com/intune-application-manager-utility).
* Fixed a bug that would cause a republished Intune product to have the content for the latest version and the metadata for version n-1.
  * This would occur if the republish flag is set and there is a new version of the application in the catalog.
* The list of Intune assignment filters is now filtered to Windows.
* Fixed a bug where in some scenarios, the republish flag would not be removed after a sync.
* Fix a possible null reference exception when loading assignments for bulk delivery optimization edits.
* Fixed a bug where the custom logging path may be reset to defaults instead of inheriting the expected value.

## 2.1.17 - 2023-09-08

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* General security fixes and improvements

## 2.1.16 - 2023-07-06

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* Update the Intune [Application Manager Utility](https://patchmypc.com/intune-application-manager-utility) to use the [aggregate reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/reports-export-graph-available-reports) for both the collection of applications, as well as application extended info. This prevents a 429 when retrieving the data.

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Updated Publisher to reflect changes in Graph API schema. This should resolve issues with the [Patch My PC Intune reports](https://patchmypc.com/power-bi-reports-for-microsoft-intune-third-party-updates).

## 2.1.15 - 2023-06-14

### Features <a href="#features" id="features"></a>

* Add support for .cmd files in pre/post-scripts.
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-2745](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-2745)

### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* The Update ID is now an available column in the [Show package info](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#PackageInfo) tool.
* Updated some graph calls to use a smaller page size. This reduces the chance of receiving a 429 or 503 response from graph.
  * The page size is configurable from 20-999 in the Advanced tab of the Publisher.&#x20;
* The product treeviews are now sorted by Vendor and then Product Name automatically.

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a bug where a ConfigMgr application’s supersedence relationship was lost when the application was upgraded in place.
* Fixed a bug where the sorting of products in the email report was in reverse alphabetical order.

## 2.1.14 - 2023-04-11

### Improvements

* Adjusted log levels of some lines to assist with troubleshooting.
* Update context menu items to reflect new labels in ConfigMgr for featured apps.
* Update several labels in the UI to be more clear on their functionality.
* The ability to set ‘Prevent the end-user from opening an application while the application is updating’ is now only allowed at the per-product level. This setting is only needed in specific scenarios, and enabling it for all products can be problematic.

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug where Intune device counts are not reporting properly.

## 2.1.13 - 2023-03-27

### Features

* Email and Webhook notifications now include information about delayed ConfigMgr applications during each sync.
  * Idea: [PATCHMYPC-I-1862](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1862)
* Add support for creating an Available assignment for All Devices. This was previously not supported by Intune. Support has been added, and the Patch My PC UI now allows it as well.

### Improvements

* Added the option to import CAB files when importing tenants.
* Email and Webhook notifications are now sent when a delayed ConfigMgr application fails to download. Previously a notification would only happen if the Publishing failed after the delay.
* Improved the cleanup of registry keys related to ‘Prevent the end-user from opening an application while the application is updating’ in [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications).

### Fixes

* Fixed a bug where PowerShell scripts for Intune were created with an encoding of UTF8 with BOM. They are now encoded as UTF8 without BOM, which is the recommended encoding based on Microsoft documentation.&#x20;
* Fixed a bug where a malformed ConfigMgr folder item (SMS\_ObjectContainerItem) would be created the first time the Publisher moved a ConfigMgr application. The result was a folder that could never be deleted.&#x20;

* Fixed a bug where retained applications may be updated unexpectedly when both postpone app and retain app are configured.
* Fixed a bug where the Publisher would run a sync every time ‘Apply Changes’ is clicked and the schedule is set to hourly.

## 2.1.0 - 2021-09-16

### Features

* Improve conflicting process timeout options

      * Note: Update max run time must be edited **before** the update is deployed for a client to recognize the change.
    * ConfigMgr App Max: Will use the configured deployment time ‘max run time.’
    * Intune App/Update Max: Will use the maximum run time of an Intune Win32 app (60 minutes minus the 15-minute buffer).

* Fixed a bug where the ConfigMgr [source folder validation](https://patchmypc.com/smsprovider-connection-and-source-folder-options#Source-Folder-Validation) would perform a partial match, such as \\\server\source\_apps being considered a conflict for \\\server\source. We now append a trailing slash to the comparison.
* Fixed a bug where the ‘Prevent Start…’ option for [Manage Conflicting Process](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) would throw an access denied error instead of the desired message box.
* Fixed a bug where assignments would be copied from Intune app to Intune updates when the copy between tabs is used.

* In the DownloadHistory.csv file, we now include the purpose of the download and the port.
* The scan wizard found application count is now updated to reflect applications found with the specified filter.
* Scriptrunner will now clean up leftover ‘Image File Execution Options’ registry keys. This helps prevent unexpected blocking of application launch in the event scriptrunner crashes and leaves behind some of these keys. We have also update the [Manage Conflicting Processes docs](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications#UpdateInProgress) to provide additional information for this scenario.
