# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.21.13

**Release Date:** 2024-04-03

## Overview

This preview release adds configurability for Azure upload chunk sizes, removes whoami calls from PowerShell detection scripts, and introduces product ID-based selection matching with improved latest version handling.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Configurable Chunk Size** - It is now possible to adjust the chunk size used for uploading chunks to Azure. It can be [adjusted between 2MB and 12MB](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-configurations-available-using-the-registry-for-patch-my-pcs-publishing-service#AzureUploaderChunkSize).

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **PowerShell Detection Update** - PowerShell detection scripts no longer call whoami. This resolves issues where the PATH environment variable may have conflicting whoami processes.
  - The '[recreate detection](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#RecreateDetection)' right-click option can be used to generate new scripts with this change. Otherwise, products will have the script updated when a new version is released.
- **Product ID Matching** - Product selections are stored and matched based on a product Id
- **Latest Product Messaging** - A message box will appear when a '[latest](https://patchmypc.com/products-multiple-versions-patch-my-pc#topic2)' product is selected. This message box contains a brief note about how products with multiple versions are handled and provides a help button for [more info](https://patchmypc.com/products-multiple-versions-patch-my-pc#topic2).
- **Content Search** - Improve how we search for ConfigMgr application content.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Script Configuration** - Fixed a bug that caused a null reference exception if a recommended pre script, and a recommended post script were configured on a product.
- **Proxy Token Access** - The configured proxy will be used to get an access token during cloud connection creation.
- **Cloud Disconnect Save** - Disconnecting from the cloud tab did not save to settings.
