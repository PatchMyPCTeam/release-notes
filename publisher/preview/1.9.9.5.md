# Publisher Preview 1.9.9.5 - 2021-01-27

## Overview

This preview release includes improvements and fixes for the Patch My PC Publisher.

## Improvements

- [We now create supersedence between republished updates. When an update is set to be republished, the option "Enable updates that supersede this update to also be superseded" is removed from the UI as this is controlled at the product level. We also now support triggering SUP sync when the option to trigger a sync schedule for updates is enabled. Based on Aha Idea: PATCHMYPC-I-211](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-211)
- Improved the XML parsing logic for certain vendor-based products

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the product 'Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect 64-bit' may not be enabled in the settings.xml
- Fixed an issue where you may be unable to select a custom software update catalog folder when the folder name contained the character ')'
