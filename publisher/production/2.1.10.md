# Publisher Version 2.1.10 - Production

**Release Date:** 2022-11-17

## Overview

This release adds the ability to limit Intune upload threads, improves scriptrunner desktop shortcut logging, and implements retry logic for Azure interactions. Multiple proxy and code signing issues are resolved.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Superseded Filter** - Added a filter for Superseded to the [Modify Updates Wizard](https://patchmypc.com/modify-published-third-party-updates-wizard).
- **Log Clarity** - Adjusted some log levels and log text to be clearer.
- **Proxy Logging** - Added additional logging when the proxy settings are loaded in the event of a failure.
- **Upload Thread Limiting** - Add the ability to limit the number of threads used during the upload of Intune packages.
  - [Documentation](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-configurations-available-using-the-registry-for-patch-my-pcs-publishing-service#AzureUploaderMaxThreadCount)
- **Desktop Shortcut Logging** - Scriptrunner will now log out a comma-separated list of all public desktop shortcuts if the installing product is configured to delete desktop shortcuts.
  - This is to help troubleshoot when icons for applications are not deleted.
- **MCP Process Enumeration** - Improved how running processes are enumerated for [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) making the popup more responsive.
- **Azure Retry Logic** - Implemented a 'retry' in the event of failure for many critical interactions with Azure via Microsoft Graph.
- **Download Cache Cleanup** - The Publisher will delete files from the download cache if there is a hash mismatch for the file. This makes the root cause of Publishing failure easier to identify.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Organization Name Parsing** - Fixed a bug where whitespace at the beginning or end of the Organization Name for [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) would cause the property to fail to parse correctly.
- **Settings Backup Rename** - Fixed a bug where old setting backups would not rename properly, causing an error during settings backup in some cases.
- **Proxy Usage** - Fixed a bug where some network operations would not use the configured proxy.
- **Code Signing Validation** - Fixed a bug where the code signing of ConfigMgr detection scripts may fail to validate the digital signature on the endpoint.
- **UseGSInstalledSoftware Registry** - Fixed a bug where the [UseGSInstalledSoftware](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-configurations-available-using-the-registry-for-patch-my-pcs-publishing-service#topic3) registry option would cause the ConfigMgr database scan to never perform a query.
- **Icon Download Failure** - Fixed a bug where a failure to download an icon would cause a product to fail to publish.
