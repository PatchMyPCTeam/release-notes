# Publisher Version 2.1.29 - Production

**Release Date:** 2024-11-03

## Overview

This release adds product icons to Intune Updates, expands localization support with three new languages, and improves webhook notification filtering for multi-tenant setups.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Intune Update Icons** - Intune Updates will now have the icon for the product associated with them.
- **Expanded Translations** - Added Czech, Finnish, and Norwegian translations for [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications).
- **Danish Translation Fix** - Fixed Danish translation for [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications).
- **Banner Image Storage** - Imported banner images are stored in the installation directory of the Publisher instead of referencing the source file.
- **Advanced Insights** - Removed the references for the SSRS reports and replaced them with [Advanced Insights](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-insights/overview).
- **Publishing History** - The Win32AppId is now included in the PatchMyPC-PublishingHistory.csv file.
- **Signed Script Handling** - Improved the handling of signed scripts when publishing. Sometimes, the Publisher would fail to replace a file and throw an exception. We now ensure the destination file is deleted before moving in the updated file.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Multi-Tenant Authentication** - Fixed a bug that caused the synchronization to stop if a tenant failed authentication. This impacted the Publisher with an MSP license and a multi-tenant setup.
- **Detection Script Discrepancy** - Fixed a discrepancy between the PowerShell detection scripts and the ScriptRunner detection logic.
- **Webhook Notification Filtering** - Fixed a bug with the filtering options for webhook notifications. The notifications should now be correctly filtered when the summary option and scope are set. For example, 'Send alerts as each product is published…' is unchecked, and only 'Include Intune update notifications' is checked.
