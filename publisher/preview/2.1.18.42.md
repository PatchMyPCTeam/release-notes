# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.18.42

**Release Date:** 2023-12-05

## Overview

This preview release adds support for configuring Win32 application max runtime in minutes, implements certificate pinning for security, and improves logging with split report lines for better CMTrace compatibility.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Win32 Max Runtime** - Add support for configuring Win32 application max runtime in minutes

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Report Lines Update** - Report lines have been updated.
  - As the catalog grows and the number of syncing products increases, our \*\*\* report line has gotten too long! CMTrace does not parse the line, and it will not show it. To prevent this, we have split up the report line into one line per type.
- **Certificate Pinning** - Implement certificate pinning. All requests to Patch My PC domains will have the certificate validated.
- **SMS Provider Safety Check** - Implement a safety check prior to deleting a ConfigMgr application. In some instances, the SMS provider returns an empty list of apps instead of a connection exception. To account for this we ensure at least one Site is returned by the SMS provider prior to application deletion.
- **ConfigMgr Script Optimization** - ConfigMgr script size is reduced. No functional changes. This should help with metadata download issues over CMG.
- **Wildcard Detection** - Add support for the ? wildcard character in detection.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Intune Only Mode** - Fixed a bug that caused a new install of Patch My PC Publisher to be in 'Intune Only Mode' regardless of the checkbox state.
- **Device Count Accuracy** - Servers are no longer included in Intune device counts.
- **Webhook Options** - Resolved a race condition which caused the additional webhook filtering options to be unavailable in some instances.
- **Download Error Logging** - Improved download engine logging to include the URL when the download fails. This was a regression that is now resolved.
- **Installation Logging Path** - The logging path for Intune [Manage Installation Logging](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#install-logging) incorrectly defaulted to the ConfigMgr path. It is now corrected to the Intune default path for logging.
- **Next Sync Time** - For some sync schedules, the 'Next Sync' time displayed in the General tab was in UTC instead of local time. The correct time should now be displayed.
