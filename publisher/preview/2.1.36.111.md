# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.36.111

**Release Date:** 2025-08-06

## Overview

This preview release enhances migration capabilities with ConfigMgr ScopeId integration, adds metadata size validation for cloud migrations, and improves product selection filter performance. Several bugs related to settings management and UI behavior are resolved.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Migration ScopeId Integration** - When enabling Migration in Publisher, send ConfigMgr ScopeId to cloud.
- **Metadata Size Validation** - Added validation to Publisher to ensure apps with over 16MB of metadata only have top level data sent to cloud for migration. (Content will not be hashed and stored)
- **Product Selection Performance** - Improved new product selection filters performance.
- **File Count Limits** - If an application being processed for Migration has more than 1000 files, mark it as not supported as Patch My PC Cloud has a limit of 1000 files per deployment.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Settings Save Issue** - Fixed a bug where settings could not be saved if product selection filter was active.
- **Log File Numbering** - Fixed issue where Migration log file would not incremement in whole numbers. (e.g. 0.1 > 0.2, instead of 1 > 2)
- **Device Count Reading** - Fixed an issue where ConfigMgr apps could not be published if the device count could not be read from ConfigMgr.
- **UI Anchor Positioning** - Fixed an issue where UI anchors were not set correctly on new icons, causing them to move around the UI.
- **Product Selection Copying** - Fixed an bug where product selections could not be copied between tabs when the new product selection filter was enabled.
- **Selection Persistence** - Fixed an issue where product selection did not persist after a save when the product selection filter was enabled/disabled.
