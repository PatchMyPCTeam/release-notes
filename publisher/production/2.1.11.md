- **ListView Filter** - Fixed a bug where some UI listviews had a broken filter.
- **MCP Window Position** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process window may be offset from the bottom right corner.
- **Pause Removal** - Fixed a bug where the [Pause](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#pause-product-updates) was never removed from Intune applications.
- **WSUS Certificate Check** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would check for the WSUS code signing certificate even if updates were disabled in some scenarios.
