# Publisher Version 2.1.36.0 - Production

**Release Date:** 2025-05-05

## Overview

This release focuses on improving ConfigMgr application processing reliability and fixing several bugs related to application management, including notification timeouts and folder selection issues.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **ConfigMgr Application Validation** - When processing a ConfigMgr app, the Publisher will validate that the PackageId found in a package.xml maps to an application deployment type with a matching content source path.
- **Content Cleanup** - If a ConfigMgr application copy fails, the left-behind content is also removed.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **MCP User Notification Timeout** - Fixed a bug that caused the MCP User Notification Timeout to not be translated from minutes to seconds when written to package.xml. The result is a notification being open for 5 seconds instead of 300 seconds, for example.
  - Note: To fix existing apps or updates with this issue [Republish the App or Update](https://patchmypc.com/when-and-how-to-republish-third-party-updates).
- **Notification Timeout Setting** - Fixed a bug that resulted in an error when attempting to save a MCP User Notification Timeout Setting.
- **Postponed Custom Applications** - Fixed a bug that caused postponed custom ConfigMgr applications to not publish as expected.
- **ConfigMgr Folder Selection** - Fixed a bug where the option to select the ConfigMgr folder within the [ConfigMgr application creation options](https://patchmypc.com/application-creation-options) was not available.
