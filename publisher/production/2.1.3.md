## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Republish Assignment Prompt** - When republishing an Intune application or update there is now a prompt asking if assignments should be recreated. The newly recreated assignments would have a deadline and available time relative to the sync when the republish happens.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **ConfigMgr Republish Relationships** - Fixed a bug where republishing a ConfigMgr application would remove existing application dependencies, supersedence, and requirements the customer may have added.
- **MCP Max Runtime** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process option to use the ConfigMgr application max run time for the notification timeout would not work for a republished ConfigMgr application.
- **Intune Assignment Removal** - Fixed a bug where republishing an Intune application or update might remove existing assignments.
- **Retained App Versioning** - Fixed a bug where we may fail to put back the version on the name of retained ConfigMgr applications in some scenarios.
- **MCP Process Identification** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process UI may fail to identify conflicting processes causing it not to show.
- **MCP Timeout Default** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process UI may default to a 5-hour timeout for ConfigMgr applications in some scenarios.
- **Delayed Applications** - Fixed a bug where delayed ConfigMgr applications may publish one day early.
- **IsFeatured Flag** - Fixed a bug where the IsFeatured flag would not be set for a republished Intune application.
- **Source Path Validation** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would fail to validate a ConfigMgr source path if there were Deployment Packages with an empty source path.
- **Content Folder Deletion** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher may delete a content folder during republishing if the binary was missing from the local content repository.
- **MCP DateTime Format** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process UI notification would fail to display if the user DateTime format and the system DateTime format were conflicting, causing DateTime parsing failures.
- **MCP Notification Timeout** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process notification timeout setting may not be read correctly from settings.xml.
