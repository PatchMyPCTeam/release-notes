# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.28.9

**Release Date:** 2024-10-25

## Overview

This preview release reverts two changes from version 2.1.28.6: PowerShell script execution now uses the -File parameter again, and Manage Conflicting Process notifications return to non-translated default behavior unless explicitly configured.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **PowerShell Script Execution** - Revert changes in Scriptrunner for the execution of PowerShell scripts. The scripts will be called using the -File parameter.
  - The changes that improve WDAC support will be re-evaluated for a future release.
  - Note: Products published with version 2.1.28.6 Scriptrunner may not correctly execute PowerShell scripts with arguments.
- **MCP Translation Behavior** - Revert the changes for translating Manage Conflicting Process notifications by default. We are returning to the original behavior. It will not be translated if the customer does not include a language in their configuration.
