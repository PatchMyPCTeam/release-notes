# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.29.42

**Release Date:** 2024-12-19

## Overview

This preview release adds support for zip file downloads in the catalog, improves settings management to prevent concurrent modification issues, and enhances backup retention. Multiple bugs related to culture-specific issues and assignment management are resolved.

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Zip File Support** - Support applications in the catalog that download a zip file.
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1463)*
  - Note: Additional backend and procedural changes are needed before this will be used. The Publisher can consume a catalog with software that downloads a zip file. We will not add any products like this until Q1-Q2 2025.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Settings Management** - Improve how the Publisher reads and writes settings.
  - Prevent the Publisher from overwriting user setting changes while a sync is happening. Previously, if a user was in the UI and clicked save while a sync was running, the user's changes could be lost.
  - Prevent the Publisher from losing Intune configuration due to an abandoned mutex.
- **WSUS Log Collection** - If found, the 'Collect Logs' button will now include the WSUS softwaredistribution.log.
- **Product Search** - Improve the product search function in the Publisher to keep the search box open when no match is found.
- **User-Based Log Paths** - Scriptrunner has improved logic for handling the log location for user-based installations. If the default values are left in the Publisher, the log path will be updated to a user-writable location. This includes the scriptrunner log and the installer log.
- **Settings Backup Retention** - Updated Publisher settings backup retention to retain settings from previous weeks and months.
- **Swedish Translation** - Update the Swedish translation for Manage Conflicting Processes based on customer feedback.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Culture-Specific Graph Queries** - Fixed a bug where Graph queries would fail if they contained a date-time filter and the machine running the Publisher had the OS set to specific cultures.
- **OriginalName Variable** - Fixed a bug where a 'BaseInstallOnlyNotForUpdating\_' prefix would appear when using the %OriginalName% variable.
- **Logging Path Validation** - Fixed a bug where an invalid logging path was allowed, causing the Publisher not to log anything to disk.
- **Dynamic Assignments Cancel** - Fixed a bug where canceling out of the Dynamic Assignments form would still apply the settings.
- **SMTP Test Email** - The test email for SMTP configuration had a blank subject and body.
- **Entra Group Resolution** - Fixed a bug causing the Manage Assignments form to hang while resolving Entra group names in some scenarios.
- **Non-Windows App Filtering** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would include non-Windows applications in the scan results for Intune auto publishing.
- **Webhook Tenant Filter** - Fixed a bug that caused webhook summary notifications not to respect the tenant filter.
- **Script Signing** - Fixed a bug that caused the Publisher to attempt to code sign Patch My PC defined scripts when the code signing option was disabled in the Publisher.
- **Install Time Offset** - Fixed a bug that caused the install time offset for Intune assignments to be displayed incorrectly in some cultures.
