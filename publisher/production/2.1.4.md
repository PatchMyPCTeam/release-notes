## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Auto-Enable Reporting** - Fixed a bug where an application may report being automatically enabled during every sync in some scenarios.
- **MCP UI User-Based Apps** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process UI would not show up for a user-based application.
- **MCP Non-Admin** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process UI would not show for an Intune application when the user is not an Administrator.
- **Collect Logs Custom Paths** - Fixed the Collect Logs button so it takes into account custom log paths as defined in the Publisher.
- **Group Search Form** - Fixed a bug causing enter to close the group search form for Manage Assignments when in the group input textbox.
- **Scriptrunner Log Cleanup** - Fixed a bug where PatchMyPC-Scriptrunner may throw an exception during log cleanup if the folder does not exist.
- **Publishing Summary** - Fixed a bug where the publishing summary in the PatchMyPC.log would not include products published from the local content repository.
- **Assignment Cancel** - Fixed a bug where changes to Intune assignments are applied even if the assignment form is cancelled.
