# Publisher Version 2.1.33 - Production

**Release Date:** 2025-02-13

## Overview

This release introduces support for applications that download zip files and significantly improves settings management to prevent data loss during synchronization. Enhanced logging and search functionality improve the overall user experience.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Zip File Support** - Support applications in the catalog that download a zip file.
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1463)*
  - Note: Additional backend and procedural changes are needed before this will be used. The Publisher can consume a catalog with software that downloads a zip file. We will not add any products like this until Q1-Q2 2025.
- **Environment Variable Expansion** - Scriptrunner will now expand environment variables provided in custom command line arguments.
- **32-bit Process Support** - Add support for Patch My PC to configure the 'Run installation and uninstall program as 32-bit process on 64-bit clients' option within ConfigMgr. This will not be a customer exposed option in the Publisher, but something that Patch My PC can set to ensure applications install as expected.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Settings Management** - Improve how the Publisher reads and writes settings.
  - Prevent the Publisher from overwriting user setting changes while a sync is happening. Previously, if a user was in the UI and clicked save while a sync was running, the user's changes could be lost.
  - Prevent the Publisher from losing Intune configuration due to an abandoned mutex.
- **WSUS Log Collection** - If found, the 'Collect Logs' button will now include the WSUS softwaredistribution.log.
- **Product Search** - Improve the product search function in the Publisher to keep the search box open when no match is found.
- **User-Based Installation Logging** - Scriptrunner has improved logic for handling the log location for user-based installations. If the default values are left in the Publisher, the log path will be updated to a user-writable location. This includes the scriptrunner log and the installer log.
- **Settings Backup Retention** - Updated Publisher settings backup retention to retain settings from previous weeks and months.
- **Swedish Translation Update** - Update the Swedish translation for Manage Conflicting Processes based on customer feedback.
- **Custom Application Search** - The search functionality in the product treeviews now consider custom applications. Previously the list of custom products would not be included in the search.
- **End-of-Life Logging** - Improved logging during a Publisher synchronization for products that are marked [end-of-life](https://patchmypc.com/how-products-are-handled-at-end-of-life-eol-or-become-incompatible) by Patch My PC.
- **Intune Terminology** - Update some labels and logging to be in line with the latest terminology used in Intune.
- **Enhanced Scriptrunner Logging** - The Update ID and Update Title are now written to the PatchMyPC-Scriptrunner log file.
- **Save Event Tracking** - The username of the user who performed a save in the Publisher is now written to the event log, and to the PatchMyPC log file. Additionally an empty file with a GUID name is included in the CAB so the save event can be matched to CAB file.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Graph Query Culture Issues** - Fixed a bug where Graph queries would fail if they contained a date-time filter and the machine running the Publisher had the OS set to specific cultures.
- **Variable Prefix Issue** - Fixed a bug where a 'BaseInstallOnlyNotForUpdating_' prefix would appear when using the %OriginalName% variable.
- **Invalid Logging Path** - Fixed a bug where an invalid logging path was allowed, causing the Publisher not to log anything to disk.
- **Dynamic Assignments Cancel** - Fixed a bug where canceling out of the Dynamic Assignments form would still apply the settings.
- **Test Email** - The test email for SMTP configuration had a blank subject and body.
- **Manage Assignments Hang** - Fixed a bug causing the Manage Assignments form to hang while resolving Entra group names in some scenarios.
- **Non-Windows Applications** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would include non-Windows applications in the scan results for Intune auto publishing.
- **Webhook Tenant Filter** - Fixed a bug that caused webhook summary notifications not to respect the tenant filter.
- **Code Signing Scripts** - Fixed a bug that caused the Publisher to attempt to code sign Patch My PC defined scripts when the code signing option was disabled in the Publisher.
- **Install Time Offset** - Fixed a bug that caused the install time offset for Intune assignments to be displayed incorrectly in some cultures.
- **Cloud Product Selections** - Fixed a bug where cloud Product Selections were only displayed in the Publisher if the product was both deployed in the cloud, and selected in the Publisher. Products which are not selected in the Publisher will now properly show as managed by the cloud if a deployment exists.
