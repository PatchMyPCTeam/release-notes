# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.18.55

**Release Date:** 2023-12-22

## Overview

This preview release implements WMI reconnection when SMS provider queries fail, improves uninstall string detection logic, and fixes several bugs related to Manage Conflicting Processes and custom app integration.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **WMI Reconnection** - Implement an attempted reconnect when a WMI query fails against the SMS provider.
- **Uninstall String Logic** - Improved scriptrunner logic for finding uninstall strings. DisplayVersion will now have any "-" or "\_" replaced by a "." when searching for uninstall strings. This matches the behavior of our script based detection.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **MCP Configuration Exit** - Fixed a bug that caused a Null Reference Exception when exiting the [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) configuration in the Intune apps or Intune updates tab.
- **Naming Convention Overwrite** - Fixed a bug that caused the [custom naming convention](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#IntuneNamingConvention) for ConfigMgr applications to be overwritten during a sync in some cases.
- **Custom Apps Token** - Fixed a bug where the authorization token can expire when connecting to Custom Apps, requiring a service restart.
- **Right-Click Loss** - Fixed a bug where Right-Click selections for "All Products" on the "Intune Apps" tab would be lost when custom apps was enabled.
