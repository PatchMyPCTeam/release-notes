# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.15.3

**Release Date:** 2023-06-16

## Overview

This preview release updates the Intune Application Manager Utility to use aggregate reports to prevent 429 errors, and reflects changes in the Graph API schema for Patch My PC Intune reports.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Aggregate Reports** - Update the Intune [Application Manager Utility](https://patchmypc.com/intune-application-manager-utility) to use the [aggregate reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/reports-export-graph-available-reports) for both the collection of applications, as well as application extended info. This prevents a 429 when retrieving the data.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Graph API Schema** - Updated Publisher to reflect changes in Graph API schema. This should resolve issues with the [Patch My PC Intune reports](https://patchmypc.com/power-bi-reports-for-microsoft-intune-third-party-updates).
