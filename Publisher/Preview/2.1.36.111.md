### Improvements

* When enabling Migration in Publisher, send ConfigMgr ScopeId to cloud.
* Added validation to Publisher to ensure apps with over 16MB of metadata only have top level data sent to cloud for migration. (Content will not be hashed and stored)
* Improved new product selection filters performance.
* If an application being processed for Migration has more than 1000 files, mark it as not supported as Patch My PC Cloud has a limit of 1000 files per deployment.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed a bug where settings could not be saved if product selection filter was active.
* Fixed issue where Migration log file would not incremement in whole numbers. (e.g. 0.1 > 0.2, instead of 1 > 2)
* Fixed an issue where ConfigMgr apps could not be published if the device count could not be read from ConfigMgr.
* Fixed an issue where UI anchors were not set correctly on new icons, causing them to move around the UI.
* Fixed an bug where product selections could not be copied between tabs when the new product selection filter was enabled.
* Fixed an issue where product selection did not persist after a save when the product selection filter was enabled/disabled.
