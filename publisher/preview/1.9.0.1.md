# Publisher Preview 1.9.0.1 - 2020-09-18

## Overview

This preview release includes features, improvements, and fixes for the Patch My PC Publisher.

## Features

- [Added a checkbox to temporarily disable publishing updates and/or packages to WSUS without disabling products. Based on Aha Idea: PATCHMYPC-I-716](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-716)

## Improvements

- Validate that the certificate selected can be used to code-sign at the time of selection
- Improved the checking logic that ensures the certificate installed is trusted by the WSUS server. The check will now be performed on the certificate used for code-signing rather than the one installed on WSUS
- Improved various error messages shown when selecting a certificate and a certificate is missing or is no longer installed

## Fixes

- Fixed an issue where certain Microsoft Intune authentication errors could cause the Publishing Service to crash
