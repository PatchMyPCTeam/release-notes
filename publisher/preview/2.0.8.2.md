## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Deleted Scope Exception** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would throw an exception if a ConfigMgr scope is deleted, but still associated with a product in the Publisher.
- **Intune Email Reports** - Fixed a bug where Intune email reports would not include the warning regarding missing local content for applications
- **Process Name Display** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process window may not show the proper process name in the list of conflicting applications.
- **Retention with Delay** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher did not respect the ConfigMgr app retention settings when the delay in-place upgrade feature was also in use.
- **Temp Content Directory** - Fixed a bug where Intune apps and updates would not use the temp content download directory specified in the advanced tab.
- **Culture Revision Bug** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would revise ConfigMgr apps every sync in certain cultures (The known issue was with Russian, but could impact others).
- **Slack Webhook Reversion** - Fixed a bug where the alert webhook configured for Slack may revert to a Teams webhook causing malformed messages.
