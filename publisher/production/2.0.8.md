# Publisher Version 2.0.8 - Production

**Release Date:** 2021-07-12

## Overview

This release improves the 'Close and Update' button to gracefully close applications before terminating, adds pre/post scripts for uninstall operations, and introduces support for multiple webhook endpoints.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Graceful Application Close** - Manage Conflicting Process 'Close and Update' button will now call the CloseMainWindow first. If the conflicting application is still running after 20 seconds we fall back to the Kill method. This gives the user 20 seconds to respond to any 'save' prompts or other app-closing windows.

- **Uninstall Scripts** - Pre/Post scripts for uninstall.

- **MCP for Uninstall** - Manage Conflicting Process settings also apply to uninstall. This ensures that a user will be prompted to close software for the uninstall as well.

- **Multiple Webhooks** - Allow multiple webhooks so alerts are posted to multiple endpoints.

- **MSI Reboot Suppress** - MSI uninstall performed by Scriptrunner will append REBOOT=ReallySuppress to the uninstall command.
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1332)*
- **MSI Uninstall Logging** - MSI uninstall performed by Scriptrunner will generate an MSI log file if logging is configured for the application in the Publisher.

- **File Size Display** - The [Show Package Info](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#PackageInfo) wizard will now show the file size from the catalog.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Timestamping Fallback** - If publishing an update fails with timestamping then we will attempt to publish again without timestamping.
- **Connection Testing** - Improved connection testing to patchmypc.com:443 during publisher sync.
- **WSUS Cleanup** - During Publisher sync the WSUS cleanup for 'Unneeded update files' will now run.
- **MCP UI Scaling** - Manage Conflicting Process UI should now scale better vertically.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Script File Validation** - Fix user validation of the input fields for pre/post script when the file does not exist.
- **Intune Detection Script** - Fixed Intune detection script which was looking for a non-existent 'dn' property.
- **Version Parsing** - Fixed Intune detection script so that it will parse invalid version parts that exceed a 32-bit signed integer.
- **ConfigMgr Detection Script** - Fixed ConfigMgr detection script so that the RegKeyDetection work as expected for enhanced detection based on additional registry key values (Script Version: 3.1).
- **App Manager Exception** - Fixed a bug where double-clicking an item in the Intune App Manager would cause an 'Index out of Range' unhandled exception. This now opens the Manage Assignment wizard as expected.
- **Task Sequence Checkbox** - Fixed a bug where ConfigMgr applications with only user-based deployment types would have the checkbox set to allow installation during a task sequence, which is not allowed.
- **UI Notification Log** - Fixed a bug where the UI notification log file may not be created if the folder does not exist.
- **Application Experience** - Fixed a bug where user-based ConfigMgr applications may not have the Application Experience configuration properly configured.
