# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.16.59

**Release Date:** 2023-09-01

## Overview

This preview release improves Intune file cleanup, updates CSV export headers, and fixes bugs with the right-click menu and Selective Sync feature.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Intune Cleanup** - Improve cleanup of files during the synchronization of Intune.
- **CSV Export Headers** - Updated the "Enabled" header of CSV exports in scan wizards to be less specific.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Root Right-Click Menu** - Fixed a bug that caused the right-click menu at the root to sometimes not display correctly.
- **Selective Sync Tabs** - Fixed a bug with 'Selective Sync' where Intune Apps and Intune Updates were swapped
  - This would not cause the wrong thing to be published, but it might cause something to not be published at all during a selective sync.
