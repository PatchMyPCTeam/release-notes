# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.5.1

**Release Date:** 2022-06-09

## Overview

This preview release improves vendor-level option visibility, updates UI messaging for WSUS options, and fixes bugs related to sync timing, Intune authentication proxy, and republishing code signing.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Vendor Level Visibility** - Setting [Delete Desktop Shortcut…](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#delete-shortcut) or [Disable Self-Updater](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#disable-updates) at the vendor level will now display the list of affected products similar to when these selections are made at the All Products level.
- **UI Message Update** - Updated language in the Update Republish message box to reflect new UI changes for Advanced WSUS options.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Multiple Sync Runs** - Fixed a bug where a sync may run multiple times back to back.
- **Intune Auth Proxy** - Fixed a bug where Intune authentication did not use the configured proxy.
- **Republish Code Signing** - Fixed a bug where [republishing](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#republish-updates) an Intune application or update would not update the code signing configuration of the detection script. Republishing an Intune application or update will now update the detection and requirement scripts and code signing configuration as needed.
