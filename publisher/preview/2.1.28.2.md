# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.28.2

**Release Date:** 2024-10-03

## Overview

This preview release adds product icons to Intune Updates, introduces default translations for Manage Conflicting Processes in multiple languages (Czech, Finnish, Norwegian), and replaces SSRS report references with Advanced Insights.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Intune Update Icons** - Intune Updates will now have the icon for the product associated with them.
- **Default Translations** - If the customer does not provide translations for a given language and this language is pre-translated by Patch My PC, we use those strings when we display the UI notification for [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications).
  - This results in the default behavior of the notifications being translated to the locale of the device if Patch My PC provides a translation.
- **New Language Support** - Added Czech, Finnish, and Norwegian translations for [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications).
- **Danish Translation Fix** - Fixed Danish translation for [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications).
- **Banner Image Storage** - Imported banner images are stored in the installation directory of the Publisher instead of referencing the source file.
- **Advanced Insights** - Removed the references for the SSRS reports and replaced them with [Advanced Insights](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-insights/overview).

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Multi-Tenant Authentication** - Fixed a bug that caused the synchronization to stop if a tenant failed authentication. This impacted Publisher with an MSP license and a multi-tenant setup.
- **Detection Script Discrepancy** - Fixed a discrepancy between the PowerShell detection scripts and the ScriptRunner detection logic.
- **Webhook Notification Filtering** - Fixed a bug with the filtering options for webhook notifications. The notifications should now be correctly filtered when the summary option and scope are set. For example, 'Send alerts as each product is published…' is unchecked, and only 'Include Intune update notifications' is checked.
