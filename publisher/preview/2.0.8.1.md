- **CSV Product Export** - Export the list of enabled products and their right-click configurations to a CSV. This option is available in the Advanced tab of the Publisher. Only enabled products are exportable.
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1064)*
- **Source Path Validation** - Publisher will validate the ConfigMgr application source path. A path is considered invalid if it is not a UNC path, or if the path is in use by a Software Update Deployment Package. Existing invalid configurations will not be impacted, but there will be an alert via email or Teams if alerts are enabled.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Scan Wizard Accessibility** - Added tooltips to fields in the scan wizards to improve accessibility.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **MCP Countdown Text** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process UI may continue to append text instead of having a countdown when it is set to 'Do not allow user deferral…'
- **Script Copy Timing** - Fixed a bug where pre/post uninstall scripts would only copy into the ConfigMgr source during a new application publisher. Scripts will now be copied into the source during the sync after the configuration change.
- **Assignment Grace Period** - Fixed a bug where the Intune Assignment UI would allow an invalid grace period/restart/snooze configuration.
- **MSI Uninstall Command** - Fixed a bug where PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner would create an invalid command line for an MSI uninstall in some cases.
