## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Script Redownload** - If a PMPC-defined pre or post-script is missing from the content source for ConfigMgr applications, then the Publisher will redownload it during a sync or republish.
- **Hash Logging** - The expected and actual hash of files found in the local content repository is now added to the log in debug mode. This has always been the case for files downloaded from the internet.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Intune Scan Wizard** - Fixed a bug where non-Windows devices may show up in the [Intune scan wizard](https://patchmypc.com/scan-intune-for-supported-products) drill-in.
- **Retention and Republish** - Fixed a bug where republishing an Intune product would cause the application to be deleted from Intune if retention was also enabled and set to zero.
- **WSUS Certificate Check** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would not check the WSUS certificate validity unless at least one WSUS update was selected.
- **Postponed Application Requirements** - Fixed a bug where the requirements for Workstation or Server OS would not be set for postponed ConfigMgr applications.
