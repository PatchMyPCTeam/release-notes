## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Catalog Timestamp** - PatchMyPC.log file now includes the timestamp for the catalog that is processed.
- **Redirected URL Logging** - When a download happens we now write the redirected URL to the PatchMyPC.log as well as in the PatchMyPC-DownloadHistory.csv.
- **Package.xml Retry** - The Publisher will now retry every 10 seconds up 12 times when saving Package.xml for ConfigMgr applications. This helps account for file locks caused by antivirus.
- **Email Report Dark Mode** - Email report has been updated (dark mode)
- **Scan Wizard Filter Operators** - Add an operator dropdown in the filter options for Intune and ConfigMgr scan wizards
- **MCP Scaling** - Improve Manage Conflicting Process configuration window to better support scaling

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Illegal File Path Characters** - Fixed a bug where illegal characters were allowed in file paths, such as a custom log path.
- **Auto-Enable Reporting** - Fixed a bug where an application may report being automatically enabled during every sync in some scenarios.
- **User-Based MCP UI** - Fixed a bug where the [Manage Conflicting Process](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) UI would not show up for a user-based application.
- **Non-Admin MCP Display** - Fixed a bug where the [Manage Conflicting Process](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) UI would not show for an Intune application when the user is not an Administrator.
- **Custom Log Paths** - Fixed the Collect Logs button so it takes into account custom log paths as defined in the Publisher.
- **Group Search Form** - Fixed a bug causing enter to close the group search form for Manage Assignments when in the group input textbox.

- **Assignment Cancellation** - Fixed a bug where changes to Intune assignments are applied even if the assignment form is cancelled
- **MCP Company Portal** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process window would not show up when the product install is triggered via Company Portal as a non-admin user
