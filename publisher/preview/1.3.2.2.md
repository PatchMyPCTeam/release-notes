## Overview

This preview release includes improvements and features for the Patch My PC Publisher.

## Improvements

- We will now cache the list of supported products, so in the event, the settings tool can't download the latest products, it will use the last cached copy
- When the settings tool is opened, if any products are previously enabled that now have a Patch My PC defined recommended and required Pre/Post script(s) those scripts will be saved in the settings.xml automatically

## Features

- Added support for required Pre/Post-Scripts
