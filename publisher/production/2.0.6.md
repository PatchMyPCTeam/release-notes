## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Uninstall String Improvements** - ScriptRunner should be more resilient when a product specifies multiple potential uninstall strings.
- **Intune Group Lookup** - In the Intune group lookup window it is now possible to hit enter to submit the lookup, or double-click a group to select that group. Additionally, the window will now remember its last position.
- **Update List Default** - The list of updates enabled by default now includes the word '(default)' and the rows have a gray font.
- **Group Search History** - When searching for an Intune Group in the lookup windows, the window will remember the last searched term.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Culture Decimal Separators** - Fixed a bug in the Publisher and ScriptRunner where periods used as decimal separators may not work properly if the Windows culture setting is configured to use a comma.
- **CMTrace Compatibility** - Fixed a bug where logs from ScriptRunner and the manage conflicting process UI may not open properly in CMTrace in some cultures.
- **Package Info Slash Handling** - Fixed a bug with the 'Show Package Info' wizard where the product name included a slash '/' character. The wizard will fail to fill in the table.
- **Empty Group Enumeration** - Fixed a bug in Publisher where processing an empty Azure group would cause an unhandled exception causing the synchronization to fail.
