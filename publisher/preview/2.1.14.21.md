# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.14.21

**Release Date:** 2023-06-02

## Overview

This preview release updates the Intune Scan Wizard to use graph report export endpoints to prevent 429 errors, and adds automatic product sorting by vendor and name.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Graph Report Export** - Updated the [Intune Scan Wizard](https://patchmypc.com/scan-intune-for-supported-products) to use [graph report export endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/fundamentals/reports-export-graph-available-reports). This will prevent the Publisher from getting a 429 return code when scanning for discovered applications.
- **Automatic Product Sorting** - The product treeviews are now sorted by Vendor and then Product Name automatically.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Email Report Sorting** - Fixed a bug where the sorting of products in the email report was in reverse alphabetical order.
