## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Path Autocomplete** - Text boxes within the UI now implement an autocomplete for file paths and URLs.
- **Update Language** - The [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) notification will now display 'update' based language for an Intune Update. For example, the button will say 'Close and Update' instead of 'Close and Install.'

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Deleted Scope Exception** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would throw an exception if a ConfigMgr scope is deleted, but still associated with a product in the Publisher.
- **Intune Email Warnings** - Fixed a bug where Intune email reports would not include the warning regarding missing local content for applications.
- **Source Folder Validation** - Fixed a bug where the ConfigMgr [source folder validation](https://patchmypc.com/smsprovider-connection-and-source-folder-options#Source-Folder-Validation) would perform a partial match. We now append a trailing slash to the comparison.
- **Prevent Start Error** - Fixed a bug where the 'Prevent Start…' option for [Manage Conflicting Process](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) would throw an access denied error instead of the desired message box.
- **Assignment Copying** - Fixed a bug where assignments would be copied from Intune app to Intune updates when the copy between tabs is used.
- **Custom Return Codes** - Fixed a bug where custom return codes set in the catalog were not processed for updates by the Publisher.
- **Application Revision** - Fixed a bug where ConfigMgr applications would be revised every sync when the Manage Conflicting Process option is set to an option other than 'Notify'.
