# Publisher Version 2.0.2 - Production

**Release Date:** 2021-02-23

## Overview

This release improves ScriptRunner's reboot handling with custom exit codes and retry logic, adds a ScriptRunner log file placeholder to email templates, and fixes culture-specific time formatting issues.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Reboot Exit Codes** - ScriptRunner will look for an exit code indicating a reboot is needed and will optionally translate this to a soft-reboot code. This ensures that an Intune-deployed Win32 app will be detected properly while also asking for a user reboot within the Company Portal.
  - Hard reboot codes supported: 3010, 1641
  - Soft reboot code: 1641 (Currently, Intune defines this as the only soft reboot code, so 3010 is changed to 1641)
- **Uninstall Retry** - ScriptRunner will only retry an uninstall one time. This prevents retrying uninstall attempts more than twice.
- **ScriptRunner Log Placeholder** - Added a placeholder for ScriptRunner log file to the email template section.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Email Template Formatting** - Fixed a bug where the email template would not resolve the %%NextScheduledRun%% placeholder in certain cultures.
