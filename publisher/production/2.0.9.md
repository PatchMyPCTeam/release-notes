## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1521)*

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Scan Wizard Tooltips** - Added tooltips to fields in the scan wizards to improve accessibility.
- **Content Preservation** - The Publisher will not delete the local content for a product if the publishing of the product failed.
- **Automatic Revision** - The Publisher will automatically revise an update if the applicability rules or description is updated in the catalog.
- **Log Rollover** - The Publisher now supports log rollover of up to 10 log files. Previously we would only retain one rollover log. This is configurable in the General tab of the Publisher above the max log size.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **MCP Process Name** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process window may not show the proper process name in the list of conflicting applications.
- **Retention with Delay** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher did not respect the ConfigMgr app retention settings when the delay in-place upgrade feature was also in use.
- **Temp Download Directory** - Fixed a bug where Intune apps and updates would not use the temp content download directory specified in the advanced tab.
- **Culture-Specific Revision** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would revise ConfigMgr apps every sync in certain cultures (The known issue was with Russian, but could impact others).
- **Slack Webhook Reversion** - Fixed a bug where the alert webhook configured for Slack may revert to a Teams webhook causing malformed messages.
- **MCP Countdown Text** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process UI may continue to append text instead of having a countdown when it is set to 'Do not allow user deferral…'
- **Pre/Post Script Copying** - Fixed a bug where pre/post uninstall scripts would only copy into the ConfigMgr source during a new application publisher. Scripts will now be copied into the source during the sync after the configuration change.
- **Assignment UI Validation** - Fixed a bug where the Intune Assignment UI would allow an invalid grace period/restart/snooze configuration.
- **MSI Uninstall Command** - Fixed a bug where PatchMyPC-ScriptRunner would create an invalid command line for an MSI uninstall in some cases.
- **MCP Process Enumeration** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process UI would fail to enumerate some properties of the blocked processes causing it to close the blocking process before the user can interact.
