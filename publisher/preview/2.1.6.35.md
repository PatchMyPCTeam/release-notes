# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.6.35

**Release Date:** 2022-09-23

## Overview

This preview release allows the same Azure group to be assigned multiple times, enables passing variables into pre/post-scripts, adds content extraction capabilities, and allows conflicting processes to be configured for any app.

> **Note:** Did I miss 33 preview builds???? No, you did not. Patch My PC has started to increment version numbers automatically as changes are reviewed and merged. The result is preview builds having multiple internal builds before a public preview is released.

  - Note: the %ProductName% and %VendorName% variables are Base64 encoded when they are passed to the pre and post-scripts. It will need to be decoded. Patch My PC will provide a sample PowerShell snippet to decode the resulting parameter.
