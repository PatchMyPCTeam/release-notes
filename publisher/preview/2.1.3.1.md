# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.3.1

**Release Date:** 2022-02-07

## Overview

This preview release restores timestamp configuration that was inadvertently reverted in previous builds, ensuring proper timestamping of updates and PowerShell scripts.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Timestamp Configuration Restore** - Fixed a bug where the timestamp configuration was reverted to disabled, and the server blank for customers with preview builds enabled. The timestamp configuration will be reverted to the last known good configuration for impacted customers.
  - Note: If updates or applications were published while on preview 2.1.2.1, or if you are a preview customer on 2.1.3.0, then the updates and PowerShell scripts would not be timestamped during this time. This preview restores a valid timestamp
