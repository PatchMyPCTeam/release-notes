## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **JSON Export and Import** - Added a new JSON export and import tool for settings and Intune apps. This is enabled from the tools menu. The Advanced, General, ConfigMgr, and Intune tabs are supported for export and import. There are other options like 'Templates' and 'Conflicting Process' that are exportable but not importable. The Intune App export and import tool is accessed from the Intune apps tab.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Adobe Flash Player** - Adobe Flash Player is disabled by default on the Windows 10 and Office tabs. Note that with the March patches this has been removed by Microsoft through security updates.
- **File Version Logging** - Log file versions for files that are downloaded or exist when the Publisher performs a content download.
- **Content Download** - Perform content downloads for two products at the same time to improve sync performance.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Install Behavior** - Fixed a bug where the [Install Behavior](https://patchmypc.com/configmgr-application-install-behavior-custom-setting) may not be set when the application is first published, but applies during later revisions.
- **Release Type Detection** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would fail to detect some ConfigMgr pre-release updates.
- **Sync Schedule** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would fail to schedule the next sync for specific sync time schedules in some cases.
