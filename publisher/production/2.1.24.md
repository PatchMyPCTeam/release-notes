# Publisher Version 2.1.24 - Production

**Release Date:** 2024-05-30

## Overview

This release addresses critical startup issues related to temporary directory configuration and Intune application registration secret storage.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Temporary Directory Fallback** - If the temporary file location configured in the Publisher does not exist, we now fall back to the system temporary directory. Previously, if this directory did not exist the PatchMyPcService would fail to start.
- **Secret Storage Format** - Fixed a bug where the secrets, such as the Intune application registration secret, would not be saved in the correct format on the first UI open for a new install.
