# Publisher Preview Version 2.0.4.1

**Release Date:** 2021-05-05

## Overview

This preview release adds Slack alert support, reverts the ScriptRunner administrator requirement in preparation for user-based applications, and fixes category-related revision issues.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Slack Alerts** - Send alerts to Slack
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-684)*
  - Note: Slack notifications are a work in progress.
- **ScriptRunner Revert** - Reverted a Scriptrunner change which flagged the exe to always run as Administrator. This is in preparation for supporting user-based applications in Intune and ConfigMgr.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Category Revision Loop** - When a user or admin category was selected on a ConfigMgr application the Publisher would create a revision of the application every synchronization. Now a revision will only be created if a user or admin category needs to be added.
- **Timestamp Proxy Logging** - Improved logging when checking access to timestamp.digicert.com if a proxy is defined
