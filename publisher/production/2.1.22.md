# Publisher Version 2.1.22 - Production

**Release Date:** 2024-04-16

## Overview

This release adds configurable Azure upload chunk sizes, improves PowerShell detection scripts, and introduces visual indicators in the product treeview for products requiring special attention. Additional translations for Manage Conflicting Processes are included.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Configurable Chunk Size** - It is now possible to adjust the chunk size used for uploading chunks to Azure. It can be [adjusted between 2MB and 12MB](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-configurations-available-using-the-registry-for-patch-my-pcs-publishing-service#AzureUploaderChunkSize).

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Detection Script Optimization** - PowerShell detection scripts no longer call whoami. This resolves issues where the PATH environment variable may have conflicting whoami processes.
  - The '[recreate detection](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#RecreateDetection)' right-click option can be used to generate new scripts with this change. Otherwise, products will have the script updated when a new version is released.
- **Product Selection Matching** - Product selections are stored and matched based on a product Id.
- **Latest Product Notification** - A message box will appear when a '[latest](https://patchmypc.com/products-multiple-versions-patch-my-pc#topic2)' product is selected. This message box contains a brief note about how products with multiple versions are handled and provides a help button for [more info](https://patchmypc.com/products-multiple-versions-patch-my-pc#topic2).
- **Content Search** - Improve how we search for ConfigMgr application content.
- **Cloud Connection Browser** - When creating the cloud connection in the Publisher, the System Default browser will now be used.
  - If needed, the embedded web browser can still be used with a [registry flag](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-configurations-available-using-the-registry-for-patch-my-pcs-publishing-service#MsalUseEmbeddedWebView).
- **Log Collection** - The '[Collect Logs](https://patchmypc.com/logging-options#collectlogs)' button now collects all PowerShell detection scripts modified within the last 7 days. The scripts are renamed to have a .txt extension before being added to the zip file.
- **Additional Translations** - Additional default translations added to Manage Conflicting Processes.
  - Added German, Danish, Norwegian and Swedish
  - Fixed Dutch translation
- **Treeview Icons** - Icons in the product treeview now indicate if the product requires local content, or is configured to skip the install if running by default.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Null Reference Exception** - Fixed a bug that caused a null reference exception if a recommended pre script, and a recommended post script were configured on a product.
- **Proxy for Cloud Connection** - The configured proxy will be used to get an access token during cloud connection creation.
- **Cloud Disconnection** - Disconnecting from the cloud tab did not save to settings.
