# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.0.1

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Database Scan Button** - ConfigMgr database scan button is now available on the ConfigMgr apps tab as well as the Updates tab.
- **Intune Folder Paths** - ScriptRunner will always use Intune-based folders when executing from an Intune app installation.
- **Uninstall Child Process Monitoring** - ScriptRunner will now monitor for child processes during the uninstall of software. This ensures that uninstalls which spawn child processes do not exit immediately and cause a detection error.
- **Path Length Validation** - Prevent using a ConfigMgr source path that could cause paths to exceed the 256 Windows path limit.
- **Script Processing** - Fixed a bug where publishing would proceed even if a custom script failed to be processed.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Detection Script Behavior** - Fixed a bug where Recreate Detection Script option for ConfigMgr would cause the wrong 'Installation Behavior' to be set for user-based apps.
- **Parameter Parsing** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher and ScriptRunner would fail to parse a parameter with nested quotes and spaces.
- **PreventStart Bypass** - Fixed a bug where PreventStart UI would fail to be bypassed when a SYSTEM launched a conflicting process potentially leaving behind Image File Execution Option registry keys.
- **Retained App Updates** - Fixed a bug where retained applications may be updated unexpectedly when both postpone app and retain app are configured.
- **Hourly Schedule Sync** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would run a sync every time 'Apply Changes' is clicked and the schedule is set to hourly.
