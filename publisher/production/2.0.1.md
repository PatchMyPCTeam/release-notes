## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Detection Script Improvements** - Improved Intune detection script for device-context apps. The new version of the script should now properly evaluate old pre-2.x Publisher installed apps as installed. The new script version has additional commenting for readability. This does not impact user-context apps since they have always used the advanced detection provided by the catalog.
- **Update Manager Enhancements** - Improved [Update Manager](https://patchmypc.com/update-manager-utility-for-managing-third-party-updates-and-applications) to display Intune updates with their current status.
- **Sync Performance** - Improved the time it takes to complete a sync when processing many updates.
- **Import Validation** - Improved validation for the Intune assignment import feature.
- **Tray Icon Visibility** - The Publisher tray icon will be more visible in dark mode.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Assignment Detection** - Fixed a bug where an assignment change may not be detected if changing the notification/restart options for an assignment.
- **Update Import** - Fixed a bug where the Intune assignment import may import the wrong type of assignment causing update imports to work for apps and vice-versa.
- **Update Name Handling** - Fixed a bug where customer-specified Product Update names would fail to be set for Intune.
- **ScriptRunner Detection** - Fixed a bug where ScriptRunner would detect the app as not-detected when a MSI with an upgrade code is installed. ScriptRunner should now try the upgrade code before trying the product code.
- **Application Revisions** - Fixed a bug where ConfigMgr applications may be revised every sync for some products.
