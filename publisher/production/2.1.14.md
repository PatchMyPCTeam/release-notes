# Publisher Version 2.1.14 - Production

**Release Date:** 2023-04-11

## Overview

This release adjusts logging levels for better troubleshooting, updates UI labels to align with ConfigMgr terminology, and restricts certain settings to per-product configuration to prevent problematic configurations.

- **Featured Apps Labels** - Update context menu items to reflect new labels in ConfigMgr for featured apps.
- **UI Label Clarity** - Update several labels in the UI to be more clear on their functionality.
- **Application Blocking Scope** - The ability to set 'Prevent the end-user from opening an application while the application is updating' is now only allowed at the per-product level. This setting is only needed in specific scenarios, and enabling it for all products can be problematic.
