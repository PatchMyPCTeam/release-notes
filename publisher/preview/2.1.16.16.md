- **Conflicting Process Auto-Enable** - Fixed a bug where Manage Conflicting Processes may be enabled if ['Add the executable name in the deployment type's install behavior'](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#install-behavior) is enabled. This is unexpected behavior that will no longer occur.
