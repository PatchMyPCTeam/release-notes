# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.2.1

**Release Date:** 2022-01-28

## Overview

This preview release adds support for maintaining application dependencies in Intune, prompts for assignment recreation during republish, and fixes numerous bugs related to republishing ConfigMgr and Intune applications.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Intune Dependencies** - Support for maintaining application dependencies in Intune
  - Checkbox added to Intune Options window: "Update application dependencies from previously created applications when an updated application is created"
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1326)*

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Assignment Recreation Prompt** - When republishing an Intune application or update there is now a prompt asking if assignments should be recreated. The newly recreated assignments would have a deadline and available time relative to the sync when the republish happens.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **ConfigMgr Republish Relationships** - Fixed a bug where republishing a ConfigMgr application would remove existing application dependencies, supersedence, and requirements the customer may have added.
- **MCP Max Run Time** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process option to use the ConfigMgr application max run time for the notification timeout would not work for a republished ConfigMgr application.
- **Intune Assignment Preservation** - Fixed a bug where republishing an Intune application or update might remove existing assignments.
- **Retention Version** - Fixed a bug where we may fail to put back the version on the name of retained ConfigMgr applications in some scenarios.
- **MCP Process Detection** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process UI may fail to identify conflicting processes causing it not to show.
- **MCP Timeout Default** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process UI may default to a 5-hour timeout for ConfigMgr applications in some scenarios.
- **Delayed App Timing** - Fixed a bug where delayed ConfigMgr applications may publish one day early.
- **IsFeatured Flag** - Fixed a bug where the IsFeatured flag would not be set for a republished Intune application.
- **Deployment Package Validation** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would fail to validate a ConfigMgr source path if there were Deployment Packages with an empty source path.
- **Content Folder Deletion** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher may delete a content folder during republishing if the binary was missing from the local content repository.
- **DateTime Parsing** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process UI notification would fail to display if the user DateTime format and the system DateTime format were conflicting, causing DateTime parsing failures.
- **Timeout Setting** - Fixed a bug where the Manage Conflicting Process notification timeout setting may not be read correctly from settings.xml.
