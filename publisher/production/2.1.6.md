# Publisher Version 2.1.6 - Production

**Release Date:** 2022-06-15

## Overview

This release improves vendor-level right-click option visibility and fixes critical issues with sync timing, Intune authentication proxy usage, and republishing code signing configurations.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Vendor Level Visibility** - Setting [Delete Desktop Shortcut…](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#delete-shortcut) or [Disable Self-Updater](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#disable-updates) at the vendor level will now display the list of affected products similar to when these selections are made at the All Products level.
- **Republish Message** - Updated language in the Update Republish message box to reflect new UI changes for Advanced WSUS options.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Multiple Sync Runs** - Fixed a bug where a sync may run multiple times back to back.
- **Intune Proxy Authentication** - Fixed a bug where Intune authentication did not use the configured proxy.
- **Republish Code Signing** - Fixed a bug where [republishing](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#republish-updates) an Intune application or update would not update the code signing configuration of the detection script. Republishing an Intune application or update will now update the detection and requirement scripts and code signing configuration as needed.
