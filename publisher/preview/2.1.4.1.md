- **DP Group Query** - Fixed a bug where we may fail to query for Distribution Point groups if the name or description is DBNull instead of an empty string.
- **SUP Sync** - Fixed a bug where the ConfigMgr SUP sync would not start after a Patch My PC Sync if only updates using local content were published.
- **Intune Auto-Publishing** - Fixed a bug where the Intune auto-publishing may fail in some cases when right-click options are configured.
