# Publisher Preview Version 2.0.7.1

**Release Date:** 2021-07-07

## Overview

This preview release adds graceful process closing, pre/post uninstall scripts, Manage Conflicting Process for uninstalls, multiple webhook support, and MSI uninstall improvements with logging and reboot suppression.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Graceful Process Close** - Manage Conflicting Process 'Close and Update' button will now call the CloseMainWindow first. If the conflicting application is still running after 20 seconds we fall back to the Kill method.
  - This gives the user 20 seconds to respond to any 'save' prompts or other app-closing windows.

- **Uninstall Scripts** - Pre/Post scripts for uninstall
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-550)*
- **MCP for Uninstall** - Manage Conflicting Process settings also apply to uninstall. This ensures that a user will be prompted to close software for the uninstall as well.

- **Multiple Webhooks** - Allow multiple webhooks so alerts are posted to multiple endpoints.
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1301)*
- **MSI Reboot Suppression** - MSI uninstall performed by Scriptrunner will append REBOOT=ReallySuppress to the uninstall command.
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1332)*
- **MSI Uninstall Logging** - MSI uninstall performed by Scriptrunner will generate an MSI log file if logging is configured for the application in the Publisher.
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1492)*
- **File Size Display** - The [Show Package Info](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#PackageInfo) wizard will now show the file size from the catalog.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Timestamping Fallback** - If publishing an update fails with timestamping then we will attempt to publish again without timestamping.
- **Connection Testing** - Improved connection testing to patchmypc.com:443 during publisher sync.
- **WSUS Cleanup** - During Publisher sync the WSUS cleanup for 'Unneeded update files' will now run.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Script File Validation** - Fix user validation of the input fields for pre/post script when the file does not exist.
- **Intune Detection Script** - Fixed Intune detection script which was looking for a non-existent 'dn' property.
- **Version Parsing** - Fixed Intune detection script so that it will parse invalid version parts that exceed a 32-bit signed integer.
- **Registry Detection** - Fixed ConfigMgr detection script so that the RegKeyDetection work as expected for enhanced detection based on additional registry key values. (Script Version: 3.1)
- **App Manager Double-Click** - Fixed a bug where double-clicking an item in the Intune App Manager would cause an 'Index out of Range' unhandled exception. This now opens the Manage Assignment wizard as expected.
- **Task Sequence Install** - Fixed a bug where ConfigMgr applications with only user-based deployment types would have the checkbox set to allow installation during a task sequence, which is not allowed.
- **Notification Log Creation** - Fixed a bug where the UI notification log file may not be created if the folder does not exist.
