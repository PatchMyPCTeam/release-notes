## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-2112)*
- **Intune Package Extraction** - It is now an option to store the encryption keys used to create the Intune package files (.intunewin). This is configurable in the Advanced tab of the Publisher. With the keys stored, you can use the [Intune Application Manager](https://patchmypc.com/intune-application-manager-utility) to download and extract the content of the Patch My PC published Intune applications and updates.
- **Granular Webhook Scoping** - Webhooks can now be granularly scoped based on provider (Slack/Teams), notification level (All/Error/Success), notification type (Updates/ConfigMgr apps/Intune apps/Intune updates/Alerts), specific product, and specific tenants. (Requires Enterprise+)
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1871)*
- **ConfigMgr Application Naming Variables** - Allow variables to be used to customize the ConfigMgr application name and localized application name. Variables available: %VendorName%, %ProductName%, %Version%, %OriginalName%.

  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-2181)*

- **Script Variables** - Pass variables into pre and post-scripts. Note: the %ProductName% and %VendorName% variables are Base64 encoded when they are passed to the pre and post-scripts.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Exception Handling** - When exceptions are thrown in the Manage Assignments form, they are now handled better by presenting a popup with the exception and a link to related documentation.
- **Accessibility Improvements** - Main form accessibility has been improved with accessibility names assigned to controls, Alt-codes added to buttons, and right-click options accessible via the Apps keyboard button or shift-F10.
- **Default Translations** - When a default Patch My PC provided translation exists for a language selected in Manage Conflicting Processes it will now automatically populate the text upon adding the language.
- **Parallel Intune Synchronizations** - Intune synchronizations will now happen in parallel for multi-tenancy. Up to 20 tenants synchronize at a time for this build.
- **Upload Speed** - Improve the speed of uploading packages to Intune.
- **Email Report Template** - Refactor email report template. The background is now transparent so that it will match the theme of the email client it is opened in.
- **Scriptrunner Uninstall** - PatchMyPC-Scriptrunner will now factor in the major version filter when available when searching for uninstall strings. This improves the accuracy of uninstalls in some cases.
- **Option Tooltips** - Added tooltips to some right-click options that describe why they are disabled in some cases.
- **Assignment Filter Permissions** - Improved the error handling within the Intune Assignments forms regarding permissions for managing Assignment Filters.
- **PowerBI Date Formatting** - Format the dates using ISO 8601 formatting when doing the Intune App export for PowerBI reporting. This improves international support.
- **WSUS Form Accessibility** - Improved the accessibility of the WSUS Options form.
- **Error Messaging** - Improve error messaging and logging for unhandled exceptions.
- **Child Form Handling** - Improved child-form handling in some cases, so they now open in the center of the parent form.
- **Multi-Selection Views** - Multi-selection views, such as selecting application scopes or categories, now use a consistent form that allows filtering.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Paused Products Email** - Fixed a bug that caused the Paused products section in the email alert to be empty.
- **Retained Application Versions** - Fixed a bug where we would not put back the version on retained applications if the configuration was set to remove the version from application names and update existing application metadata.
- **Assignment Edit Exception** - Fixed a bug in the Intune application manager tool that caused an unhandled exception if you attempted to edit an assignment with a deadline in the past.
- **Settings Backup Format** - Fixed a bug where the settings backups were stored in a non-sortable format.
- **Scan Wizard Filters** - Fixed a bug where the filters were not applied in the scan wizards when filtering the data.
- **ConfigMgr Database Scan** - Fixed a bug where the ConfigMgr database scan may throw an exception due to a malformed query.
