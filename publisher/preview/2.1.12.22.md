# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.12.22

**Release Date:** 2023-01-31

## Overview

This preview release adds delayed ConfigMgr application information to email/webhook notifications, changes PowerShell script encoding to UTF8 without BOM, and fixes several bugs related to folder management and logging.

---

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Delayed App Notifications** - Email and Webhook notifications now include information about delayed ConfigMgr applications during each sync.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Delayed App Failure Alerts** - Email and Webhook notifications are now sent when a delayed ConfigMgr application fails to download. Previously a notification would only happen if the Publishing failed after the delay.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **PowerShell Encoding** - Fixed a bug where PowerShell scripts for Intune were created with an encoding of UTF8 with BOM. They are now encoded as UTF8 without BOM, which is the recommended encoding based on [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/apps/apps-win32-add).
- **ConfigMgr Folder Items** - Fixed a bug where a malformed ConfigMgr folder item (SMS\_ObjectContainerItem) would be created the first time the Publisher moved a ConfigMgr application. The result was a folder that could never be deleted.
- **XML Generation** - Fixed a bug where having a product marked with [exclude from auto-publishing rules](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#exclude-from-scanning) and a [custom naming convention](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#IntuneNamingConvention) or [pause](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#pause-product-updates) set would cause invalid XML to be generated.
- **Collect Logs Filenames** - Fixed a bug where the Collect Logs feature would fail if a company name contained characters that are invalid for file names.
- **Scriptrunner Logging** - Fixed a bug where PatchMyPC Scriptrunner logging did not use an invariant datetime format. This could cause CMTrace to fail to parse the logs.
