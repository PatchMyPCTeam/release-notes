# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.13.6

**Release Date:** 2023-04-04

## Overview

This preview release adjusts log levels for better troubleshooting, updates context menu items to reflect new ConfigMgr labels, and restricts the 'Prevent updating' setting to per-product level only.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Logging Adjustments** - Adjusted log levels of some lines to assist with troubleshooting.
- **Featured Apps Labels** - Update context menu items to reflect new labels in ConfigMgr for featured apps.
- **UI Label Clarity** - Update several labels in the UI to be more clear on their functionality.
- **Prevent Updating Scope** - The ability to set 'Prevent the end-user from opening an application while the application is updating' is now only allowed at the per-product level. This setting is only needed in specific scenarios, and enabling it for all products can be problematic.
