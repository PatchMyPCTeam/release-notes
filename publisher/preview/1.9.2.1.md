# Publisher Preview 1.9.2.1 - 2020-10-07

## Overview

This preview release includes major features and improvements for the Patch My PC Publisher.

## Features

- [User-based installations for ConfigMgr Applications are now supported. This includes appropriate detection method changes, and appropriate ScriptRunner logic to handle user-based installations. There is an option in the advanced tab for existing users to enable this to be automatically changed. For new customers, User Based Installations are enabled by default](https://patchmypc.com/support-for-user-based-installations-with-configuration-manager)

## Improvements

- The VersionDetectionLimit environment variable can now support values above 5

- When starting a sync through the Run button, the UI now disables the Save, Sync History, and Run buttons
