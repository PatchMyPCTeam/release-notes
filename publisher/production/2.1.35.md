# Publisher Version 2.1.35 - Production

**Release Date:** 2025-04-23

## Overview

This release enhances Intune Manage Conflicting Processes capabilities, improves logging and sync performance, and adds Japanese localization support. Multiple bug fixes improve stability and user experience.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Extended Maximum Run Time** - Allow a maximum run time of 1440 minutes for Manage Conflicting Processes for Intune.
- **Enhanced Scriptrunner Logging** - Add the user name, user domain, device name, session ID and Windows OS version to the PatchMyPC-Scriptrunner.log.
- **Certificate Validation** - Collect additional information regarding certificate validation failures.
- **Japanese Localization** - Add Japanese localization text for Manage Conflicting Processes.
- **Application Copy Safety** - Stop processing a ConfigMgr application if the copy operation for retention fails. This ensures we do not edit an existing app unless the copy succeeds.
- **Sync Time Logging** - Added the total sync time to the PatchMyPC.log.
- **Cloud Connection Logging** - Improved logging when there is a cloud connection, but no Intune deployments in the cloud.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Right-Click Performance** - Fixed a bug that caused some right-click options, such as setting an update to metadata only, to take a long time to apply when set at the 'All Products' level.
- **Product Selection Loading** - Fixed a bug that caused the Publisher to fail to load the complete list of selected products from settings.
- **CVE Import Wizard** - Fixed a bug causing the Publisher to fail to process selections from the CVE Import Wizard.
- **Search Box Retention** - Fixed a bug that caused the treeview searchbox not to retain the previous search text.
- **Scriptrunner Placeholder Expansion** - Fixed a bug causing scriptrunner not to expand placeholder arguments such as %CURRENTDIR% when parsing command line arguments.
- **Mutex Timeout** - Fixed a bug causing errors similar to 'Mutex access requested by GetIntuneAppProductFlags but a timeout occurred while waiting for mutex to be released'.
- **Custom Application Files** - Fixed a bug that caused custom applications to fail if they had two files with the same name inside their content.
- **Email Report Accuracy** - Fixed a bug that caused email reports to erroneously indicate a pause product for tenants that do not have the product enabled.
