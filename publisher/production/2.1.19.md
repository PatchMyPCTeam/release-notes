## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Report Line Restructure** - *** Report lines have been updated.
  - As the catalog grows and the number of syncing products increases, our *** report line has gotten too long! CMTrace does not parse the line, and it will not show it. To prevent this, we have split up the report line into one line per type.
- **Certificate Pinning** - Implement certificate pinning. All requests to Patch My PC domains will have the certificate validated.
- **ConfigMgr Safety Check** - Implement a safety check prior to deleting a ConfigMgr application. In some instances, the SMS provider returns an empty list of apps instead of a connection exception. To account for this, we ensure at least one Site is returned by the SMS provider prior to application deletion.
- **ConfigMgr Script Size** - ConfigMgr script size is reduced. No functional changes. This should help with metadata download issues over CMG.
- **Wildcard Support** - Add support for the ? wildcard character in detection.
- **UI Notifications** - Improve some popup notifications to direct the user to the correct tab.
- **Service Shutdown** - Improve cleanup during service shutdown.
- **Login Authority** - Update the default login authority for Intune. It is now [https://login.microsoftonline.com](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)
  - This will not affect existing Intune configurations. It is only a change to the defaults for a new connection.
- **SMS Provider Reconnect** - Implement an attempted reconnect when a WMI query fails against the SMS provider.
- **Scriptrunner Uninstall Logic** - Improved scriptrunner logic for finding uninstall strings. DisplayVersion will now have any "-" or "_" replaced by a "." when searching for uninstall strings. This matches the behavior of our script based detection.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Documentation Link** - Fixed a dead 'More Info' link for WSUS certificate management.
- **Dependency Removal** - Fixed a bug causing dependencies to be removed from an Intune Win32 application when republishing.
- **Publish Now and Delayed Apps** - Fixed a bug where publish now and delayed ConfigMgr apps did not work as expected.
- **Intune Only Mode** - Fixed a bug that caused a new install of Patch My PC Publisher to be in 'Intune Only Mode' regardless of the checkbox state.
- **Device Counts** - Servers are no longer included in Intune device counts.
- **Webhook Race Condition** - Resolved a race condition which caused the additional webhook filtering options to be unavailable in some instances.
- **Download Logging** - Improved download engine logging to include the URL when the download fails. This was a regression that is now resolved.
- **Logging Path** - The logging path for Intune [Manage Installation Logging](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#install-logging) incorrectly defaulted to the ConfigMgr path. It is now corrected to the Intune default path for logging.
- **Next Sync Time** - For some sync schedules, the 'Next Sync' time displayed in the General tab was in UTC instead of local time. The correct time should now be displayed.
- **Content Lookup Logging** - Fix logging during the creation of Intune products when local content lookup fails. The Publisher would incorrectly log that the existing application would be deleted.
- **Uninstall Arguments** - Fixed a bug causing Enforced Uninstall Arguments to be ignored for ConfigMgr apps. This resulted in some ConfigMgr apps being created with an uninstall that may not work as expected. The next sync after the Publisher is updated will fix these products' uninstall configuration.
- **Connection Name Required** - The connection name is now required in the Cloud tab.
- **Null Reference Exception** - Fixed a bug that caused a Null Reference Exception when exiting the [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) configuration in the Intune apps or Intune updates tab.
- **Naming Convention** - Fixed a bug that caused the [custom naming convention](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#IntuneNamingConvention) for ConfigMgr applications to be overwritten during a sync in some cases.
- **Token Expiration** - Fixed a bug where the authorization token can expire when connecting to Custom Apps, requiring a service restart.
- **Product Selection Loss** - Fixed a bug where Right-Click selections for "All Products" on the "Intune Apps" tab would be lost when custom apps was enabled.
