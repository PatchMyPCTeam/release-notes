# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.28.6

**Release Date:** 2024-10-24

## Overview

This preview release adds Win32AppId to publishing history, improves signed script handling, and modifies PowerShell script execution for WDAC compatibility. Note: Changes in this version were reverted in 2.1.28.9.

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Win32AppId in History** - The Win32AppId is now included in the PatchMyPC-PublishingHistory.csv file.
- **Signed Script Handling** - Improved the handling of signed scripts when publishing. Sometimes, the Publisher would fail to replace a file and throw an exception. We now ensure the destination file is deleted before moving in the updated file.
- **WDAC PowerShell Support** - Scriptrunner now calls PowerShell scripts without using the -File parameter. This improves compatibility in environments that use WDAC.
