## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Additional Translations** - Adding German and Dutch translations to [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#manage-conflicting-processes).
- **Intune Filter Management** - Intune Filter viewing and configuration is now available in all instances of managing Intune Win32 assignments in the Publisher.
- **CAB Format Backups** - All setting backups are now in a .CAB format. The import setting option now allows for .XML or .CAB import to ensure we support importing older setting files.
- **User Desktop Shortcuts** - The [Delete desktop shortcut…](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#delete-shortcut) right-click option now removes shortcuts from the user desktop for user-based applications.
- **SMS Provider Highlight** - The SMS provider button is now highlighted in the WSUS options if the SMS provider is not configured.
- **Default MCP Banner** - Updated default [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#manage-conflicting-processes) banner.
- **OS Requirements Update** - ConfigMgr operating system requirements are now recreated when an application is updated. This ensures new operating systems such as Windows 11 or Server 2022 are added as applications are updated in place.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Scriptrunner Uninstall String** - Fixed a bug where scriptrunner may fail to find the uninstall string in the registry for some products.
- **Installation Validation** - Fixed a bug where scriptrunner may fail to validate an installation after the installer completes causing a 3-minute delay after the installation completes.
- **Pause with Postponed Binaries** - Fixed a bug where [Pause](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#pause-product-updates) does not account for postponed binaries. If there is an existing postponed binary it will publish even if a pause is set.
- **Publishing Summarization** - Fixed a bug where some publishing summarization info was miscounted in the PatchMyPC.log file.
- **Empty Folder Cleanup** - Fixed a bug where the Publisher would leave behind an empty folder when Publishing a ConfigMgr application and the download fails.
- **Version Numbering** - Fixed a bug where a version number would be appended to the current ConfigMgr application instead of the retaining application if the download fails. This bug affected customers who had the 'Do not include version…' option configured as well as the 'Retain…' option.
- **Empty Tenant** - Fixed a bug where an empty Intune tenant is written to settings causing errors when the Publisher attempts to query the invalid tenant.
- **MST Form Layout** - Fixed the layout of the [Add MST transformation file](https://patchmypc.com/custom-options-available-for-third-party-updates-and-applications#mst-transform) form.
- **Distribution Point Groups** - Fixed a bug where we may fail to query for Distribution Point groups if the name or description is DBNull instead of an empty string.
- **SUP Sync** - Fixed a bug where the ConfigMgr SUP sync would not start after a Patch My PC Sync if only updates using local content were published.
- **Auto-Publishing** - Fixed a bug where the Intune auto-publishing may fail in some cases when right-click options are configured.
