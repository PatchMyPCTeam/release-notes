# Publisher Preview Version 2.0.4.2

**Release Date:** 2021-05-19

## Overview

This preview release adds the ability to view and customize conflicting processes, lists all conflicting processes in the UI notification dropdown, and includes CVE information in all Publisher alerts.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Customize Conflicting Processes** - View and customize Conflicting Processes list
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1382)*
- **Process List Dropdown** - The UI notification for Conflict Processes now lists all processes which are conflicting in a dropdown. This is to make it more clear what software will be closed.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **CVE in All Alerts** - Publisher SMTP alerts for the creation of ConfigMgr apps, Intune apps, and Intune updates will all now show the CVE information. Previously only the WSUS updates would show this information.
- **Script Window Notes** - Added notes to the pre/post script window to help clarify the feature functionality.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Revision Loop** - Fixed a bug where software may be marked for revision during every sync of the Publisher. This would occur when PreventConflictingProcessRestart was in use and the KillProcess was set instead of Notify.
- **Auto-Publishing Exclusion** - Fixed a bug where the 'Exclude from Auto-Publishing' option for Intune apps and Intune updates may not work as expected causing excluding software to still be published if found.
