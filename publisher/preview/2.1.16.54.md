## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Conflicting Process Auto-Enable** - On the ConfigMgr Apps tab, if the option «Add the executable name in the deployment type's install behavior» is enabled, the Manage Conflicting Process is automatically enabled to kill processes.
- **Assignment Tool Sorting** - Fix crash when sorting some columns in the [Manage Assignments tool](https://patchmypc.com/intune-application-manager-utility).
- **Republish Content Mismatch** - Fixed a bug that would cause a republished Intune product to have the content for the latest version, and the metadata for version n-1.
  - This would occur if the republish flag is set, and there is new version of the application in the catalog.
- **Assignment Filter List** - The list of Intune assignment filters is now filtered to Windows.
- **Republish Flag Persistence** - Fixed a bug where in some scenarios the republish flag would not be removed after a sync.
- **Delivery Optimization Exception** - Fix a possible null reference exception when loading assignments for bulk delivery optimization edits.
