## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Default Browser for Cloud** - When creating the cloud connection in the Publisher, the System Default browser will now be used.
  - If needed, the embedded web browser can still be used with a [registry flag](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-configurations-available-using-the-registry-for-patch-my-pcs-publishing-service#MsalUseEmbeddedWebView).
- **PowerShell Script Collection** - The '[Collect Logs](https://patchmypc.com/logging-options#collectlogs)' button now collects all PowerShell detection scripts modified within the last 7 days. The scripts are renamed to have a .txt extension before being added to the zip file.
- **Content Requirement Icons** - Icons in the product treeview now indicate if the product requires local content, or is configured to skip the install if running by default.
