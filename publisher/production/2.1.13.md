# Publisher Version 2.1.13 - Production

**Release Date:** 2023-03-27

## Overview

This release adds notification support for delayed ConfigMgr applications, enables All Devices assignments in Intune, and fixes multiple logging encoding issues that affected CMTrace compatibility.

---

## Features

New capabilities and functionality added in this release.

- **Delayed Application Notifications** - Email and Webhook notifications now include information about delayed ConfigMgr applications during each sync.
  - *[Requested by users](https://ideas.patchmypc.com/ideas/PATCHMYPC-I-1862)*
- **All Devices Assignment** - Add support for creating an Available assignment for All Devices. This was previously not supported by Intune. Support has been added, and the Patch My PC UI now allows it as well.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **CAB File Import** - Added the option to import CAB files when importing tenants.
- **Delayed Application Failure Notifications** - Email and Webhook notifications are now sent when a delayed ConfigMgr application fails to download. Previously a notification would only happen if the Publishing failed after the delay.
- **Registry Cleanup** - Improved the cleanup of registry keys related to 'Prevent the end-user from opening an application while the application is updating' in [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications).

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **PowerShell Script Encoding** - Fixed a bug where PowerShell scripts for Intune were created with an encoding of UTF8 with BOM. They are now encoded as UTF8 without BOM, which is the recommended encoding based on Microsoft documentation.
- **ConfigMgr Folder Item** - Fixed a bug where a malformed ConfigMgr folder item (SMS_ObjectContainerItem) would be created the first time the Publisher moved a ConfigMgr application. The result was a folder that could never be deleted.
- **XML Generation** - Fixed a bug where having a product marked with exclude from auto-publishing rules and a custom naming convention or pause set would cause invalid XML to be generated.
- **Collect Logs** - Fixed a bug where the Collect Logs feature would fail if a company name contained characters that are invalid for file names.
- **Scriptrunner Logging** - Fixed a bug where PatchMyPC Scriptrunner logging did not use an invariant datetime format. This could cause CMTrace to fail to parse the logs.
- **Intune Application Manager** - Fixed a bug where an exception may occur if deleting a large number of Intune Applications using the Intune Application Manager Utility.
- **Data Export DateTime** - Fixed a bug where some data exports would result in malformed date time strings. This occurred if a culture used the same character for the number group separator and for time parts.
- **Detection Script Logging** - Fixed a bug where ConfigMgr detection script logging did not use an invariant date-time format. This could cause CMTrace to fail to parse the logs.
- **Manage Conflicting Process Logging** - Fixed a bug where Manage Conflicting Process logging did not use an invariant date-time format. This could cause CMTrace to fail to parse the logs.
- **Uninstall Abort** - Fixed a bug where the option to abort an uninstall if the prescript failed caused an argument parsing exception.
- **Settings Backup** - Fixed a bug where the automatic backup of setting changes would fail in certain cultures due to a date-time parsing issue.
- **Naming Convention Copy** - Fixed a bug where custom naming conventions were copied between tabs. We no longer copy naming conventions when copying products between tabs.
