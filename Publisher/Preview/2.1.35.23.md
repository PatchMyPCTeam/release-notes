### Improvements <a href="#improvements" id="improvements"></a>

* When processing a ConfigMgr app, the Publisher will validate that the PackageId found in a package.xml maps to an application deployment type with a matching content source path.
* If a ConfigMgr application copy fails, the left-behind content is also removed.

### Fixes <a href="#fixes" id="fixes"></a>

* Fixed a bug that caused the MCP User Notification Timeout not to be translated from minutes to seconds when written to package.xml. The result is a notification being open for 5 seconds instead of 300 seconds, for example.
  * Note: To fix existing apps or updates with this issue [Republish the App or Update](https://patchmypc.com/when-and-how-to-republish-third-party-updates).
* Fixed a bug that resulted in an error when attempting to save a MCP User Notification Timeout Setting.
* Fixed a bug that caused postponed custom ConfigMgr applications to not publish as expected.
* Fixed a bug where the option to select the ConfigMgr folder within the [ConfigMgr application creation options ](https://patchmypc.com/application-creation-options)was unavailable.
