## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Assignment Error Handling** - When exceptions are thrown in the Manage Assignments form they are now handled better by presenting a popup with the exception and a link to related documentation.
- **Main Form Accessibility** - Main form accessibility has been improved.
  - Accessibility names are assigned to many controls to provide context
  - Alt-codes are added to most buttons that did not have them before
  - Right-click options are now accessible via the Apps keyboard button or shift-F10
- **MCP Translation Defaults** - When a default Patch My PC provided translation exists for a language selected in [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) it will now automatically populate the text upon adding the language.

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **Paused Products Email** - Fixed a bug that caused the Paused products section in the email alert to be empty.
- **Retained App Versions** - Fixed a bug where we would not put back the version on retained applications if the configuration was set to remove the version from application names and update existing application metadata.
- **Past Deadline Assignment** - Fixed a bug in the [Intune application manager](https://patchmypc.com/intune-application-manager-utility#topic3) tool that caused an unhandled exception if you attempt to edit an assignment with a deadline in the past.
