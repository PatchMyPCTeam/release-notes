# Publisher Preview Version 2.1.9.27

**Release Date:** 2022-11-07

## Overview

This preview release improves process enumeration for Manage Conflicting Processes, implements retry logic for Azure/Graph interactions, and improves download cache handling with hash-mismatch detection.

---

## Improvements

Enhancements to existing functionality.

- **Process Enumeration** - Improved how running processes are enumerated for [Manage Conflicting Processes](https://patchmypc.com/manage-conflicting-processes-when-updating-third-party-applications) making the popup more responsive.
- **Azure Retry Logic** - Implemented a 'retry' in the event of failure for many critical interactions with Azure via Microsoft Graph.
- **Download Cache Cleanup** - The Publisher will delete files from the download cache if there is a hash-mismatch for the file. This makes the root cause of Publishing failure easier to identify.

---

## Fixes

Bug fixes and issue resolutions.

- **ConfigApi Database Scan** - Fixed a bug where the [UseGSInstalledSoftware](https://patchmypc.com/advanced-configurations-available-using-the-registry-for-patch-my-pcs-publishing-service#topic3) registry option would cause the ConfigMgr database scan to never perform a query.
- **Icon Download Failures** - Fixed a bug where a failure to download an icon would cause a product to fail to publish.
